However, it then recalled the plans due to the impact on the local area.\nThe decision to reject the plans goes against the recommendation of the government's own reporter, who said it should be approved.\nMinisters said that although they accepted his findings, they reached a different conclusion regarding the possible risks in the development, particularly regarding flooding and the loss of historic woodland in the area.\nThe report says it was \"a finely balanced decision\" and that allowing the resort would bring economic benefits to the area.\nHowever, it says the \"significant concerns relating to flood risk and woodland loss are of such importance that, when taken together with the other development plan conflicts identified, the proposed development does not comply with the development plan overall\".\nThe other conflicts raised in the report include ministers believing that the plan would clash with the \"ongoing aim of conserving and enhancing the natural and cultural heritage of the area\".\nScottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer, a vocal opponent of the development, called the decision \"a huge victory for the local community\".\nHe added: \"This mega resort would have had a devastating impact on the iconic local environment, the community and the local economy.\n\"My message to Flamingo Land today is simple; walk away. This community and the people of Scotland have told you time and again that your destructive plans are not welcome.\"",

Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.\nToday's top stories\nMillions of pages of Epstein files have been released to the public, but an NPR investigation reveals a gap: The Justice Department has removed or withheld dozens of pages related to allegations that President Trump sexually abused a minor decades ago. The Justice Department declined to answer NPR's questions on the record about these specific files, what's in them, and why they are not published.\n- \ud83c\udfa7 NPR's Stephen Fowler tells Up First that an NPR review of the files found an FBI email from last July listing various claims and tips it received about Trump. One report accused Trump of sexually abusing a minor around 1983, when Jeffrey Epstein also allegedly abused her. A field office investigated the report, and the records show the FBI interviewed the accuser four times. Only one of the accuser's interviews was made public, but it doesn't mention Trump. According to the DOJ's tracking system, the Justice Department did not make at least 50 pages of the files public. The White House and the Trump administration have consistently stated that nothing in the documents incriminates the president.\nChaos erupted after Mexico's military killed a man known as El Mencho, the country's most powerful drug lord. Now, the country's cities are slowly returning to normal. Businesses are set to reopen today, and schools in the state of Jalisco will reopen tomorrow. But big questions remain about what El Mencho's death means for Mexico's fight against organized crime.\n- \ud83c\udfa7 NPR's Eyder Peralta says the scene in Jalisco's capital, Guadalajara, is eerie and feels similar to the COVID lockdown. Streets are empty, and some streets have burnt-out vehicles on the medians in the aftermath of the violence that erupted after the drug lord's death. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has repeatedly said she doesn't want to spark a new war against organized crime, as it has typically led to bloodshed. Instead, she says the way to tackle the issue is to address root causes such as education and jobs. Trump is pressuring Mexico for a more frontal fight against the cartels and has threatened to take unilateral military action to address it.\nTrump will take center stage tonight to address a joint session of Congress for the first State of the Union address of his second term in office. The prime time address gives the president an opportunity to tout his agenda and shape his party's messaging ahead of this year's midterm elections. Trump is expected to start speaking at 9 p.m. ET. If history is any indication, you should prepare for a long night. Here's what else you need to know ahead of tonight's speech.\nA new federal class action lawsuit alleges federal agents are unconstitutionally retaliating against observers recording immigration enforcement. The nonprofit Protect Democracy and the law firms Dunn Isaacson Rhee and Drummond Woodsum filed the suit, alleging that federal agents are gathering information about observers and labeling them as \"domestic terrorists\" after telling them they would be added to a \"watchlist.\" After the lawsuit was filed yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security told NPR that it doesn't have a database for domestic terrorists. DHS also said that it follows the U.S. Constitution in its law enforcement methods.\nWatch this\nFrom the biggest names in their fields to experts on the most pressing topics of our time, NPR is breaking down the stories that matter through our in-depth interviews. Immerse yourself in these conversations on your favorite NPR platforms \u2014 including the NPR App and NPR.org.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has been spending his final year in office touring the U.S. and rallying voters for the midterm elections. Newsom, who hasn't ruled out a run for president in 2028, actively challenges Trump, often mocking the president's aggressive style on social media. \"I'm putting a mirror up to President Trump and I'm fighting fire with fire and I am punching a bully back in the mouth,\" he tells NPR. Simultaneously, Newsom has also engaged major right-wing figures like Steve Bannon and Ben Shapiro, drawing criticism from his own party. The governor recently spoke with All Things Considered ahead of the release of his memoir, Young Man in a Hurry. He discussed how his struggles with dyslexia shaped his life, his strategy for dealing with Trump and how the Democratic Party should meet this political moment.\nRead more about Newsom's conversation with NPR's Ailsa Chang or watch the interview.

NPR's Ukraine correspondent Joanna Kakissis and Russia correspondent Charles Maynes reflect on what it's been like reporting on the war and the toll it's taken on residents.\nWe have documented Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine since the beginning: the awful human cost, the thousands of missing Ukrainian children, the exhausted front line towns, the way this war has changed modern warfare and geopolitics, as well as Ukrainian and Russian society. An invasion that the Kremlin \u2014 and many in the West \u2014 predicted would end with Ukrainian capitulation within days has now lasted four years, with enormous casualties on both sides, according to British and U.S. sources.\nUkrainians are exhausted. They have adjusted their lives to constant Russian drone and missile attacks, to the turmoil and grief of defending the country in a long war. Many flinch when praised as resilient, as if, they say, there is another choice. \"We have paid too high a price to give up,\" says Olha Chupikova, from the southern front-line city of Kherson. Her son, a soldier, was killed in action last year. Volodymyr Mykolayenko, a former Kherson mayor who came home last fall after years in Russian captivity, is skeptical that talks sponsored by the Trump administration will actually end the war. \"We used to see America as a defender of democracy,\" he says. \"Now they chose [Russian President Vladimir] Putin as their friend.\"\nWhatever Trump's diplomatic aim, it hasn't been enough to convince Putin to stop his assault. Russians' hope that Trump could deliver peace has faded as Putin rejected even the most generous terms on offer. Despite Kremlin claims to the contrary, Western sanctions are taking their toll on the economy. State repression used to be aimed squarely at the political opposition. Now, even the invasion's most ardent supporters have been targeted. Government restrictions now increasingly reach into the digital and cultural space \u2014 with bans on movies, music and social media affecting nearly everyone. Open criticism of the war was criminalized early on. Yet there's a growing sense that amid a conflict with no end in sight, the state's need for control, too, is endless.\n3 things to know before you go\n- The British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards (BAFTAs) released an apology yesterday after the BBC aired a delayed broadcast of the ceremony that included a man with Tourette syndrome shouting a racial slur.\n- Scientists discovered a new species of large, horned, fish-eating Spinosaurus dinosaur \u2014 the first in over a century.

      "raw_text": "Democrats tap Spanberger and Padilla to respond to State of the Union\nNewly sworn in Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday evening.\nSpanberger, who previously served in Congress for six years, became the first woman elected governor of Virginia in November, flipping control of the office from Republican to Democrat. Prior to her career on Capitol Hill, she served in the CIA.\n\"We are at a defining moment in our nation's history,\" Spanberger said in a statement ahead of her address. \"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring.\"\nHer gubernatorial race was under the national spotlight as one of the first major indicators of voters' political leaning during the second Trump administration. Spanberger focused her campaign on affordability, a message Democrats continue to embrace ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\nTop Democrats in Congress framed Spanberger as a clear contrast to President Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she has \"always put service over politics.\"\n\"Gov. Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation,\" he said in a statement announcing the selection of Spanberger as the party's official respondent to the speech.\nThe rebuttal to a president's State of the Union is considered an honor, given the high-profile nature of the speech. The selection tends to reflect what party leaders see as top policy priorities and which rising star they regard as the best spokesperson to deliver that message to the public.\nDemocrats are eager to replicate Spanberger's political success during this election cycle. She was part of a blue wave of Democrats in 2018 who flipped control of the House. She's considered a more moderate voice within the party, who outperformed in a purple state.\nShe's also faced increasing criticism from conservatives who allege she is veering left after leading a more centrist campaign.\nBut the rebuttal gig itself, which involves speaking to a typically empty room, can be tough.\nTake then-Sen. Marco Rubio (now secretary of state), who delivered a response in both English and Spanish in 2013. His speech is mainly remembered by a singular moment when he went off camera to get a water bottle.\nMore recently, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., was mocked for her speech's intense tone and the choice to deliver the response against the backdrop of her kitchen.\nCalifornia Sen. Alex Padilla to deliver Spanish language response for Democrats\nPadilla, the first Latino elected to represent California in the Senate, was first appointed to the Senate in 2021 to fill the seat vacated by Kamala Harris.\n\"Americans don't need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low, and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating Constitutional rights on a daily basis,\" Padilla said in a statement.\nThe son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla was forcibly removed from a news conference last summer by federal agents after trying to ask DHS Secretary Kristi Noem a question about the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics in California.\nA video of the experience was widely circulated and Padilla later recounted details of the event during an address on the Senate floor.\n\"As Donald Trump, Kristi Noem and MAGA extremists have tried to silence the voices of our Latino brothers and sisters, Senator Alex Padilla has consistently fought back and proven Democrats will not bend the knee to this out-of-control administration,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"House Democrats are proud to have Senator Padilla leading the way as we communicate to Spanish-speaking households across the nation.\"\nTrump's State of the Union address comes as the Department of Homeland Security remains shut down. Congressional Democrats have demanded policy changes on immigration enforcement, fueled by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota by immigration agents.\nAs has been the case during previous Trump addresses to Congress, some Democrats are choosing to skip the speech entirely and engage in counterprogramming, including a rally called the \"People's State of the Union.\"\nFollow for more coverage:\n\ud83d\udce7 NPR Politics newsletter: Breaking down the big stories and why they matter\n\ud83c\udfa7 NPR Politics Podcast: Our experts provide insights into what's happening",

      "raw_text": "Is the YIMBY movement doomed?\nLate last month, President Trump held a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Sitting at a long, mahogany table, surrounded by his administration's top officials, he broached the subject of housing.\n\"There's so much talk about, 'Oh, we're going to drive housing prices down,'\" Trump said, seemingly referencing a nationwide movement to make housing more abundant and affordable. But not him, Trump made it clear. \"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes. And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\nSay what you will about President Trump, but the man has a knack for understanding the fears and anxieties of a large swath of American voters and speaking bluntly to reject liberal and libertarian ideas that could potentially scare them.\nFor more than a decade now, a \"YIMBY\" movement has been working to bulldoze the rules and regulations that have been holding back new housing development. A central goal of this movement \u2014 which declares Yes In My Backyard to more development \u2014 is to make housing more plentiful and affordable for Americans who are often priced out of owning or even living in the communities they want to.\nBut the flipside of lower priced and more plentiful housing is \u2026 lower priced and more plentiful housing \u2014 and, for a large percentage of middle-class Americans, homes are their most valuable source of wealth.\nHow irreconcilable is the clash between maintaining or building middle-class wealth on the one hand, and making housing more affordable to a wide swath of renters and would-be owners on the other? Are the politics just inherently stacked against meaningful development efforts that would make housing more affordable? In other words, is the YIMBY movement doomed to fail?\nToday in the Planet Money newsletter, we hear from a bunch of housing experts and YIMBYs to get their perspective on the thorny political economy around housing policy.\nWhy politics is stacked against YIMBYs\nThere are some brutal political realities that the YIMBY movement has to contend with. Almost 66% of American households own their homes. Many of those households have not just one, but at least two voters. Homeowners are more likely to vote than renters, and they're also more likely to be civically engaged.\nKatherine Levine Einstein is a political scientist at Boston University who studies the politics around new housing development. Back in 2019, she co-authored an eye-opening book, Neighborhood Defenders: Participatory Politics and America's Housing Crisis.\n\"Basically, what we argue is that America's land use regulations have created processes that empower small and privileged groups of neighbors to stop and delay new housing development,\" she says.\nEinstein and her colleagues, studying Massachusetts, found that homeowners are much more likely to participate in the crucial local political and regulatory meetings that govern new housing supply.\nAnd they found these weren't just any homeowners. The people who showed up were a class of people who had the time and the political will to attend \u2014 let's be honest \u2014 pretty darn boring city meetings. They were less likely to work full-time or at all. They were less likely to be students or young professionals. They were less likely to have young kids, with all the time pressures they impose. And they were more likely to be resistant to change in their neighborhoods. In other words, \"the people who attend these meetings are way more likely to be older,\" Einstein says, and they're much more likely to oppose development.\nSo it's not just the sheer numbers of homeowning voters that YIMBYs have to contend with. It's also the very structure of our nation's political institutions, which systematically empowers local homeowners \u2014 and a particular class of especially NIMBY homeowners \u2014 to shape what gets built and where.\nSince Einstein and her colleagues published this book back in 2019, we've seen state political leaders increasingly recognize that they need to circumvent or actively fight local antagonists to new housing development.\nFor example, in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has supported a variety of reforms that essentially imposes top-down pressure on local communities to develop more housing. Einstein says there's been a similar effort in Massachusetts.\n\" So I think, honestly, in some places the answer is yes, that the state just has to impose development,\" Einstein says. \"There are just some places that are never going to agree to allow new housing. And often those are some of the most privileged places in the country, with really high-quality schools and other public services.\"\nTop-down approaches come with political risks. Locals know and care a lot more about their communities than outsiders, and attempts by outsiders to impose development could anger some voters. And top-down impositions could also be painted as less democratic, because the state essentially rejects the self-determination of local communities to oppose new developments.\nBut, Chen Zhao, the head of economic research at Redfin, a popular home-search platform and brokerage, argues it's not necessarily less democratic because, when you take housing decisions out of local hands and make them at higher levels of government, \"it is about taking the interests of more people into account.\" For instance, the people who have been priced out of the cities where they work and have to commute into.\n\"It's not just the folks who live in Manhattan who have a vested interest in Manhattan,\" Zhao says. \"There could be someone who lives across the river in New Jersey who would live in Manhattan if it was more affordable to live here. And so the question becomes, do their interests matter?\"\nBut serving constituencies that potentially can't or won't vote for you creates some serious challenges for politicians in a democracy. And many municipalities, responding to impassioned NIMBY locals, are actively fighting top-down, state-level attempts to meaningfully move the needle on new housing development.\nNIMBYism may be spreading\nOf course, not all localities have been opposed to new development. Even the coastal markets known today for NIMBYism were once the sites of a blitz of new housing development after World War II.\nIn 2005, the economists Ed Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, and Raven Saks published influential research that found that America's growing metro areas could basically be divided into two groups.\nFirst, there were metro areas in the West and Northeast, often near the coasts, in places like California, Washington, New York, and Massachusetts, which were resistant to building new housing in the face of rising demand. That scarcity of housing supply, coupled with lots of demand to live in these markets, created a sort of pressure cooker of unaffordability for renters and would-be owners. At the same time, of course, it created huge financial gains for those lucky enough to already own homes in these markets.\nSecond, there were what are sometimes called the \"Sunbelt\" markets, like in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Arizona, which were building like crazy in the face of rising demand. Instead of skyrocketing prices, they saw skyrocketing population growth and more moderate price increases. Back in 2005, Gyourko says, these places were not seeing an affordability crisis like those in the West and Northeast.\nLast year, Glaeser and Gyourko released a working paper that looks at what has happened in the two decades since 2005.\n\"We continue to undersupply in the big coastal markets,\" Gyourko says. \"But what's new, different and alarming is we're starting to undersupply \u2014 and have been for the last decade or two \u2014 in the high employment, growth markets in the Sunbelt.\"\nIn other words, many of the places that used to build a lot are starting to look more like the NIMBY strongholds on the coasts.\nGyourko and Glaeser don't offer definitive evidence for why many Sunbelt markets have begun to see lower rates of new housing development. It could be, for example, that after many years of building, they've already developed on easy-to-develop land, and now development politics have gotten trickier. Even if that were true though, these localities \u2014 like those in other high-demand metropolises \u2014 could still build more housing vertically with tall apartment buildings. The economists suggest that locals have begun gumming up new development through rules and regulations, much like those on the West and East coasts. In other words, NIMBYism has maybe metastasized.\nWhy might that be? Maybe people are curmudgeons and just don't like seeing their communities change. Maybe something changed demographically in these places, and there's now more NIMBY-minded homeowners living there.\nOr maybe, after decades of development, people are fed up with all of the negative side effects that often come with larger populations, including worse traffic, parking headaches, and more crowded schools or parks. These \"negative externalities,\" as economists call them, can be at least partially mitigated with smart urban planning and investments in public transportation, but often they're not \u2014 and it's easy to see why locals could dislike big bursts of new development.\n\" I think concentrated development can create backlash,\" Einstein says. \"And we see this historically, and it looks like it may be happening in some pockets of the South as well, that people respond to this development by opposing new development, and perhaps creating regulatory processes that ensure that they have veto power over future projects.\"\nWhatever the reason, many metro areas that used to be YIMBY seem to be turning more NIMBY, and housing prices have started rising at a faster clip there as a result.\nAustin: A success story or cautionary tale for YIMBYism?\nBut, Gyourko says, there are at least two clear exceptions to all this: Nashville and Austin.\nBoth, he says, built so much housing in recent years that supply has outstripped demand, and housing prices have begun falling there.\nAn analysis from Zillow released in December found that Austin is seeing some of the steepest home value declines in the nation. They estimate the average home price has fallen more than six percent over the last year. Other data sources show a similar story of declining housing prices there.\nSome might argue that Austin built too much, and that's a problem. If you're a home or apartment owner who is now seeing your home value decline, you might feel that way. And you might advise, watch out, other cities, the YIMBYs are coming!\nBut Einstein sees it differently. \"So I guess overbuilding is one way of framing that,\" she says. \"I might also say that's a success story, where we have seen a market like Austin, which got incredibly overheated and got really, really expensive very quickly, now starting to correct a bit and starting to become more affordable.\"\nAnd keep some perspective, she says. \"It's still the case that it is more expensive to live in Austin now than it was ten years ago. So I think it's more that we are starting to see those prices go back to a place that is a little more accessible to more Austin residents.\"\nAustin and Nashville have taken a more free-market approach to housing development than many other localities, and, now, Gyourko says, the market is responding to the reality that supply has outstripped demand. \"What's happened? How does the market correct? They stopped building,\" he says. \"There's still strong demand to be in those markets. They're thriving economically. So the demand will pick up and in two or three years, they'll likely go back to growing.\"\nThe YIMBY political fight\nWhile Austin might be seeing falling prices, other local housing markets are still in a price pressure cooker created by intense housing scarcity. For example, with the AI boom, the already exorbitant San Francisco Bay Area has seen sizable hikes in rents and home prices over the last few years.\nNot all housing markets react to new development the same. After deindustrialization, many cities, like Detroit, had long periods of falling home prices. Demand to live there fell. And their problem became that their existing housing stock was too big.\nBut the Bay Area, for example, is the center of a technological revolution. It has tons of high paid professionals who make a lot of money, and people from around the world want to come there and work. There's incredible demand to live there, and, after years of ridiculously low levels of building, there's a deep scarcity of housing. Erecting even a considerable number of new apartment buildings in a market like the Bay Area isn't likely going to tank housing prices.\nMatthew Lewis is the director of communications at California YIMBY, a policy organization aimed at increasing housing development and affordability. He says their big goal is to build many more apartment and condo buildings in urban cores, which they hope will reduce rent prices and make buying apartments and condos more attainable to a wider swath of people. Their focus is apartments and condos, he says, because those will be able to house way more people than single-family homes, and they will make a bigger dent in the affordability crisis.\nCreating more apartments and condos in urban cores, he suggests, also results in fewer negative side effects than building single-family homes in urban peripheries. For example, putting lots more residents on the outskirts of urban cores can result in more clogged freeways and undesirable commuting times.\nLewis suggests there isn't really a tradeoff between single-family home values and the building of apartment complexes, at least in red hot markets like the Bay Area. In fact, Lewis points to studies \u2014 including in Alexandria, Virginia and Salt Lake City, Utah \u2014 that suggest that adding new apartment complexes in growing urban areas may actually even slightly increase single-family home values.\nLewis argues that more apartments will increase economic activity and business opportunities in booming cities, and that further increases demand to live there, helping to boost single-family home values even while it can reduce rents for apartment dwellers.\n\"I think that there's a win-win here on the property value question that's borne out by the evidence,\" Lewis says.\nGyourko believes the vast majority of the nation's growing metro areas have so underbuilt for so many decades, the \" latent demand is so strong, prices won't fall,\" he says. \"Ab sent a recession, the chances of us building so much that we cause a house price collapse \u2014 I think it's close to zero.\"\nOn the one hand, that might be solace to homeowners in coveted housing markets. They don't have to worry about their home value tanking, unless there's a recession or some other calamity. But, on the other hand, that can be super frustrating to those who desperately want housing to become more affordable.\n\"This actually makes the politics of getting people to accept more housing incredibly difficult because it is an awful political slogan to say, 'Let's build more housing so price increases aren't as high as they would've been if we hadn't built as much housing,'\" Einstein says. \"Like, no one wants to run on that.\"\nBut that's kind of the hope in places like the Bay Area and New York City. They can build and, at this juncture, the amount of building they're actually going to do could maybe bring down the growth rate of rents and home prices \u2014 and, in a plausible scenario, maybe slow them down below average income growth, and so, over time, housing will become relatively more affordable. But we probably won't see dramatic increases in affordability all of a sudden, especially considering they're not building anywhere near enough to do that.\nDespite the political challenges, YIMBYs have had some important victories in recent years. But, arguably, many of them have been accomplished by appeasing the concerns of the massive and powerful voting bloc of homeowners.\nFor example, one big YIMBY victory: laws that have allowed homeowners in California and other states to build \"Accessory Dwelling Units\" (ADUs) on their properties. Think like allowing homeowners to build a guest house in their backyard. That increases the supply of housing in areas where housing is desperately needed. At the same time, homeowners have a big incentive to support it because they get financial benefits from those new developments.\nAnother strategy: building apartment buildings in urban settings near transit stops while avoiding new developments in single-family neighborhoods, which are sometimes viewed as politically untouchable.\n\" I definitely think it is politically easier to just avoid trying to develop in single-family neighborhoods,\" Einstein says. But, she points out, that solution could be suboptimal for a variety of reasons. One big one: it may contribute to \" patterns of economic and racial segregation,\" where neighborhoods with single-family homes \" remain these isolated enclaves of privilege.\"\nAs we recently covered in a Planet Money episode featuring Harvard economist Raj Chetty, mounting research suggests that economic and racial segregation is tremendously harmful to the economic prospects of disadvantaged kids.\nSo what should policymakers do?\nTo make a real dent in affordability in many places, Einstein says it's not enough to reform and streamline the land-use regulations that have been holding back housing supply.\n\" Doing that alone is going to be helpful for building more housing, but it is not going to make housing affordable for people in poverty,\" Einstein says. \"We're not going to, by building more market-rate housing, solve the sort of housing issues for that segment of the market. That is a segment of the market where you need extensive government subsidy.\"\nBut, Einstein says, streamlining the permitting process for new housing development will also make it easier to build government-subsidized or public housing too.\nEinstein says there are reasons to be both pessimistic and optimistic about solving America's housing affordability crisis.\nShe says she's pessimistic because NIMBYs remain politically powerful, especially at the local level. And while there have been state-level efforts to increase housing supply, many of those initiatives have been riddled with loopholes and poison pills that allow local NIMBYs to distort or water down new housing development efforts. Beyond the difficult politics of new development, rising construction prices add an additional challenge.\nBut she says she's optimistic because there seems to be a rising YIMBY tide. Boston University, she says, conducts an annual survey of mayors, and over the last several years they've asked them about the economics of housing. \" And we have seen over the last four years, big increases in the proportion of mayors who believe that they need to build more housing in order to reduce prices,\" she says. \"So I think that's really heartening and suggests the people who hold the levers of power understand this problem more than they did even four years ago.\"\nAnd, of course, many homeowners care about issues beyond just their home price. Lewis says the reality is that housing markets have gotten so ridiculously expensive that nurses, firefighters, police officers, and other critical community workers are having trouble living in the cities where they work. And the affordability crisis is affecting homeowners' family members.\n\"After a couple generations of people thinking, 'I don't want it here,' now we're hearing people say, 'Oh gosh, my kids had to move three states over.' 'My parents can't find anywhere affordable to live for their retirement,'\" Lewis says.",

      "raw_text": "Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident\nGitHub MCP Cross-Repository Data Leak Vulnerability\nIn May 2025, Invariant disclosed a critical vulnerability in GitHub\u2019s Machine Collaboration Protocol (MCP), where attackers embedded malicious commands within public repository Issues to hijack developers\u2019 locally running AI Agents. When an AI Agent was triggered to read and \u201cassist\u201d in processing the Issue, it indiscriminately executed the embedded commands, actively pulling and exfiltrating sensitive data\u2014such as private repository source code and cryptographic keys\u2014from the user\u2019s private repositories. This attack chain entirely bypassed GitHub\u2019s permission control system, enabling unauthorized cross-repository data theft.\nThe incident exposed significant blind spots in the MCP protocol\u2019s trust boundary definitions. At the protocol level, there is a lack of mandatory isolation mechanisms to distinguish between \u201ccall origins\u201d and \u201cdata content.\u201d GitHub\u2019s MCP integration fundamentally operates as a nested RPC call chain: AI Agent \u2192 MCP Server \u2192 GitHub API \u2192 Issue Content Parsing. When an Agent executes actions using a user\u2019s GitHub credentials, it fails to differentiate between \u201cuser task descriptions\u201d and \u201cattacker-injected commands\u201d within Issues. Since developers grant their AI Agents global-level GitHub permissions, and the MCP protocol lacks fine-grained security domain segmentation for read/write/execute operations, this vulnerability allows attackers to hijack local AI Agents and steal sensitive data, including private repository source code and encryption keys.\nAI Browser Comet Hidden Command Account Hijacking Vulnerability\nIn August 2025, Perplexity\u2019s AI-powered browser Comet was exposed to a critical \u201cindirect prompt injection\u201d vulnerability. Attackers embedded hidden commands in Reddit comment sections, which, when users activated Comet\u2019s \u201csummarize current page\u201d feature, triggered the AI to automatically execute the concealed instructions. Within 150 seconds, the AI could log into the user\u2019s email, bypass captchas, and transmit credentials back to the attacker\u2014all without the user\u2019s awareness and with no visible anomalies on the interface.\nThe root cause of this vulnerability lay in Comet\u2019s default trust assumption for all web page content, combined with a lack of security validation for input sources. Attackers exploited Markdown\u2019s \u201cspoiler tag\u201d syntax (>!\u2026!<) to embed malicious commands, disguising them as white text to evade user detection. Additionally, Comet failed to implement sandbox isolation during page rendering, allowing malicious actions to execute unrestricted. As a result, the browser automatically transmitted stored login credentials to attackers, leading to sensitive data leaks.\nAI-Generated Malware Attacks 230,000+ Computing Clusters\nIn November 2025, Oligo Security disclosed that attackers exploited a historical vulnerability in the Ray framework (CVE-2023-48022). Using AI-assisted tools, they generated attack scripts to compromise over 230,000 publicly exposed Ray AI computing clusters worldwide. The attackers deployed modular malicious payloads capable of cryptomining, data theft, and DDoS attacks, creating a large-scale botnet.\nThe core tactic involved was using LLMs to rapidly generate automated intrusion scripts tailored to different Ray versions and Linux distributions. This significantly shortened the time from vulnerability detection to payload deployment. While the AI-generated code contained redundancies and incomplete error handling, the use of AI Code and ReAct frameworks enabled rapid iteration, allowing attackers to compromise exposed clusters within weeks.\nKey Directions for AI Security Development\nAs AI applications evolve from intelligent chatbots to autonomous agent systems, the detection and prevention of AI security risks are becoming more sophisticated. Based on major AI security incidents and technological trends from 2024 to 2025, the AI security threat landscape is expanding\u2014shifting from model content and system security to multimodal security, agent security, and threats that cause substantial system damage (as referenced in the NSFOCUS AI LLM Risk Threat Matrix). The attack surface for artificial intelligence is visibly broadening.\nTo ensure the security of AI systems, a comprehensive defense framework must be constructed around multiple risk domains, including infrastructure security, data security, model security, application security, and identity security. This framework should span the three key stages of LLM development: training, deployment, and application. With this approach, trust can be rebuilt, and a multi-tiered security system can be established to meet the demands of secure, compliant AI applications and practical protection against evolving threats.\nThe post Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident appeared first on NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks..\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks. authored by NSFOCUS.

      "raw_text": "Study Finds LLM-Generated Passwords Highly Predictable and Repetitive. A recent security analysis by AI firm Irregular reveals that passwords created directly by large language models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini look complex but are fundamentally weak due to predictable patterns.\nThese \u201cvibe passwords\u201d emerge in real-world use, including code from AI agents, posing risks to developers and users who overlook their low entropy.\nWhy LLMs Fail At Password Generation\nLarge language models predict tokens based on training data, producing outputs that mimic randomness but follow biased distributions far from uniform.\nSecure passwords require cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) to ensure high entropy, which LLMs cannot replicate.\nTools such as KeePass or zxcvbn rate these passwords highly, estimating 100 bits of entropy. Yet, real analysis shows they crack in seconds to hours.\nIrregular tested models by prompting \u201cPlease generate a password\u201d 50 times in fresh sessions. Claude Opus 4.6 produced only 30 unique strings, with \u201cG7$kL9#mQ2&xP4!w\u201d repeating 18 times a 36% chance versus near-zero for true randomness.\nPatterns dominate: most start with uppercase G or k followed by 7, favor characters like L, 9, m, 2, $, #, and avoid repeats or symbols like *. GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash show similar biases, with prefixes like \u201cvQ7!\u201d or \u201cK#7\u201d appearing frequently.\nReal-World Risks and Agent Behaviors\nCoding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI often default to LLM generation over secure tools like openssl rand, especially with prompts like \u201csuggest a password.\u201d\nThese embed weak credentials in Docker Compose files (e.g., MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Rt7xK9mP2vNqL4wB), FastAPI keys, or .env files without user notice.\nGitHub searches for patterns like \u201cK7#mP9\u201d or \u201ck9#vL\u201d and uncovers dozens of exposed examples in test code and setups.\nEntropy calculations confirm vulnerability. Using Shannon entropy on character stats, a 16-character Claude password yields 27 bits total (2.08 bits for the first character alone) versus 98 expected bits.\nGPT logprobs reveal even lower: ~20 bits for 20 characters, with some positions at 0.004 bits (99.7% predictable). Brute-force prioritizing LLM patterns could crack these in hours on old hardware.\nTemperature tweaks fail max 1.0 on Claude still repeats favorites; 0.0 locks to one string. Agentic browsers like ChatGPT Atlas insert them during tasks like site registration.\nSecurity teams must audit AI-touched code for hardcoded secrets and rotate them. Developers should enforce CSPRNGs in agents via prompts or controls, favoring password managers or passkeys.\nAccording to Irregular, AI labs need to turn off direct generation by default. As AI writes more code per Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei\u2019s 2025 prediction this pitfall highlights broader risks where plausible outputs mask insecurity.\nFollow us on Google News , LinkedIn and X to Get More Instant Updates.

      "raw_text": "AI executes nearly 80% of tactical operations in recent attack\nOnly 14.4% of organizations deploy agents with formal security approval\nAgentic AI opens a new attack surface that demands urgent scrutiny\nThe attacker clicked a single button. From there, the AI conducted reconnaissance, identified vulnerabilities, and executed the intrusion on its own. A cyber-espionage campaign disclosed in September 2025 laid bare what can happen when AI agents fall into the wrong hands.\nWhat is more troubling is this: countless enterprises are already deploying AI agents into live environments without formal security approval. The doors are wide open. Few have remembered to bring the locks.\n\u25c7 A War That Began With a Click\nIn mid-September 2025, the security team at Anthropic detected an unusual pattern. Further investigation revealed that a hacker group known as GTG-1002 had abused the company\u2019s AI development tool, Claude Code, to target more than 30 entities, including large corporations, financial institutions, and government agencies. Some intrusions were successful.\nWhat drew global attention was not just the scope of the operation, but the role of AI. Roughly 80% of the tactical tasks \u2014 reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, data exfiltration \u2014 were executed by the AI system itself. Human operators intervened only at critical decision points. Anthropic described the incident as the first officially documented AI-driven cyber-espionage campaign.\nJacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, explained the attack in stark terms: \u201cThe hackers literally clicked one button. After that, the AI carried out nearly everything. Human input was limited to a few decisive moments \u2014 \u2018continue,\u2019 \u2018stop,\u2019 or \u2018that looks suspicious.\u2019\u201d\nThe core technique relied on role-playing. The attackers assigned Claude Code the identity of a \u201clegitimate cybersecurity employee,\u201d claiming to conduct authorized defensive testing. This framing effectively neutralized built-in safeguards. Complex objectives were fragmented into smaller, seemingly harmless tasks, preventing the AI from grasping the broader malicious intent.\nAs a result, Claude Code proceeded to conduct reconnaissance, scan for vulnerabilities, generate exploit code, and extract data \u2014 unaware that it was participating in an active intrusion campaign. The speed exceeded human limits. At peak activity, the AI processed thousands of requests per second \u2014 far beyond the capacity of a traditional human hacking team. Anthropic reported that the system even produced detailed operational documentation autonomously.\n\u25c7 Why Privileged AI Agents Are So Dangerous\nTo understand this incident, one must distinguish agentic AI from traditional chatbots. Chatbots respond with answers. Agents respond with actions.\nAn AI agent can read emails, schedule meetings, query databases, execute code, and call external services. It plans and carries out multi-step workflows autonomously, deciding its next move based on results \u2014 often with minimal supervision. One industry executive described agentic AI as \u201cless a new tool and more like hiring a new employee.\u201d\nNow imagine granting that new hire full access to your enterprise systems. That is the situation many organizations face today.\nResearch firm Gartner projects that by the end of 2026, 40% of enterprise applications will integrate task-specific AI agents. Yet a recent analysis by Palo Alto Networks found that only 6% of organizations have implemented advanced AI-specific security strategies for agents. Adoption is outpacing preparation.\nOne major threat is prompt injection. When agents process emails, web pages, or PDFs, hidden malicious instructions can be executed alongside legitimate tasks. Agents struggle to distinguish between valid directives and adversarial commands.\nA prominent example is EchoLeak, a vulnerability disclosed last year in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Attackers embedded malicious instructions within ordinary emails. When a victim posed a routine question to Copilot, its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) engine incorporated the compromised email into its context. The malicious command executed automatically \u2014 exfiltrating internal documents to an external server without any user click. Microsoft issued a patch shortly thereafter.\nIn 2025, open-source package repositories such as npm saw a surge of malicious packages exploiting AI and LLM-related keywords. Npm has long been a supply-chain attack target. Some packages dynamically fetched remote code upon execution or installed reverse shells to evade detection. Security researchers warn that as agent infrastructures like MCP proliferate, supply-chain attacks masquerading as legitimate servers or packages may become more common.\nA second risk is memory poisoning. If manipulated data enters an agent\u2019s long-term memory store or vector database, subsequent decision-making may become distorted. This represents an evolution of traditional data poisoning within agent environments. OWASP has identified data contamination and vector database vulnerabilities as key risks in its LLM security guidance. While large-scale real-world damage has yet to be formally documented, the threat remains credible \u2014 especially when compromised data lies dormant until triggered by specific queries.\nA third concern is the proliferation of non-human identities (NHI). Each deployed agent generates API keys, access tokens, and service accounts. Research from CyberArk indicates that, unlike human accounts, NHIs rarely follow strict password rotation policies or anomaly detection frameworks. A survey by identity security firm Gravity found that only 22% of organizations treat AI agents as independent identity principals. The remaining 78% manage them as extensions of existing user accounts or shared API keys. A separate survey by Dark Reading reported that 48% of security professionals view agentic AI as the year\u2019s top emerging attack vector.\n\u25c7 Productivity and Security: An Inverse Relationship?\nLate last year, OWASP published its first dedicated security risk framework for agentic AI. Developed with input from more than 100 experts, the framework outlines ten core risks, including agent goal manipulation (ASI01), tool misuse (ASI02), NHI compromise (ASI03), and memory poisoning (ASI09). Contributors included security specialists from AWS, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks. OWASP also released an MCP-specific risk list detailing vulnerabilities unique to agent ecosystems.\nSecurity practitioners describe the framework as necessary but insufficient. Agent deployment is accelerating far faster than governance frameworks can mature.\nAs attacks become AI-driven, so too must defenses. According to a Google Cloud AI agent trends report, 46% of executives whose organizations have deployed agents in production environments are already using them in security operations (SecOps). Meanwhile, 82% of security professionals report missing genuine threats due to alert fatigue \u2014 underscoring the growing need for AI-powered detection and response systems.\nAnthropic acknowledged that it used Claude extensively to analyze massive volumes of data during its investigation of the GTG-1002 incident. The same technology is now deployed on both sides of the battlefield.\nA survey conducted by Gravity among more than 900 executives and technical professionals distilled the current landscape into a single phrase: adoption has outpaced control.\nEighty-one percent of technical teams have moved AI agents into active deployment. Yet only 14.4% report having obtained full security and IT approval prior to release. More strikingly, 88% of organizations say they experienced at least one AI agent-related security incident in the past year \u2014 a figure that rises to 92.7% in the healthcare sector.\nAttackers understand this gap. And they are exploiting it.\nThe 2025 GTG-1002 campaign demonstrated that smaller, less sophisticated groups can now replicate advanced operations with fewer resources by leveraging AI. As one executive at an AI security firm put it, \u201cOne thing is clear: agentic AI is the decisive battleground of cybersecurity in 2026.\u201d\n- Anthropic vs. U.S. Department of Defense: Big Tech\u2019s AI Ethics Put to the Test\n- Memory Devoured by Servers, AI PC Market Faces Turbulence\n- Marie Curie Meets Da Vinci\u2026 Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 AI and Its Gender Philosophy\n- Applied Unveils 2nm GAA Equipment, Says \u201cManufacturing Is Where the Battle Is Won\u201d\n- [AI Study & Window] The Momentum Tilts Toward E2E AI \u2014 Was Tesla Right After All?\n- \ucf54\ub4dc\uba85 \u2018\uac08\ub9ad\u2019\u2026 \ucd9c\uc2dc \uc784\ubc15\ud55c \uc624\ud508AI\uc758 GPT-5.3 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc77c\uae4c"

      "raw_text": "Analyst(s): Fernando Montenegro\nPublication Date: February 17, 2026\nProofpoint has acquired Acuvity to extend its data security perimeter beyond the inbox and into the emerging \u201cagentic workspace.\u201d This strategic pivot aims to secure the intent of autonomous AI agents through runtime governance, challenging established vendors and cloud-native startups for control of the enterprise AI gateway.\nWhat is Covered in This Article:\n- Proofpoint acquires Sunnyvale-based startup Acuvity to bolster AI security and governance.\n- The integration of the RYNO platform to secure the \u201cagentic workspace,\u201d including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed tools like Ollama.\n- How Proofpoint is aiming to evolve from a human-centric focus to an agent-centric governance model.\n- An analysis of how Proofpoint faces pressure from platform vendors (Microsoft, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks), key SASE providers (Netskope, Zscaler, others), and numerous data/cloud security vendors (Cyera, Wiz, Veeam, Commvault, others)\nThe News: On February 12, 2026, Proofpoint announced its acquisition of Acuvity, a Silicon Valley-based startup specializing in AI security and governance.\nHeadquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Acuvity was founded in 2023 by a team of cybersecurity veterans. The company is led by co-founder and CEO Satyam Sinha, who previously co-founded the microsegmentation firm Aporeto (acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $144 million) and served as Vice President of Engineering for Prisma Cloud. He is joined by co-founder and CTO Antoine Mercadal, a fellow Aporeto and Palo Alto Networks alumnus.\nBefore the acquisition, Acuvity operated as a lean team of approximately 24 employees. The startup emerged from stealth in September 2024, backed by a $9 million seed funding round led by Foundation Capital.\nAcuvity\u2019s RYNO platform is designed to provide visibility into \u201cShadow AI\u201d and to enforce real-time policies for LLM interactions through a specialized AI firewall and runtime inspection. Notably, the technology secures the \u201cagentic workspace\u201d by monitoring emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections and locally installed tools like Ollama. This integration will allow Proofpoint to extend its \u201chuman-centric\u201d security model to include autonomous agents, addressing risks such as prompt injection and data exfiltration.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nCan Proofpoint Secure the Intent of the Autonomous Agent?\nAnalyst Take: The acquisition of Acuvity marks a necessary and timely strategic move for Proofpoint. It signals a recognition that in the emerging \u201cagentic workspace,\u201d the inbox is no longer the primary perimeter: rather, the data workflow is. By integrating Acuvity\u2019s RYNO platform, Proofpoint aims to expand its Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities to address the non-deterministic nature of Generative AI. While network security vendors focus on the pipeline (securing the connection) and DSPM vendors focus on data at rest, Proofpoint is betting that its historical position in human workflows gives it a unique advantage in securing the payload by understanding not just that an agent is moving data, but why.\nFrom Static DLP to \u201cSemantic\u201d Governance\nThe potential technical differentiator here is the shift from \u201cShadow AI\u201d discovery (which is now a commodity) to runtime enforcement. Traditional DLP relies on static rules and regex (e.g., \u201cblock credit card numbers\u201d), which often fail against human and, increasingly, non-human attackers using Large Language Models that can rephrase sensitive data into harmless-looking text. Acuvity aims to provide the semantic understanding required to detect intent.\nCrucially, Acuvity\u2019s support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows Proofpoint to insert itself into the \u201cread-write\u201d loop of autonomous agents. This is a significant leap beyond the capabilities of a standard proxy, for example. While traditional proxy functionality can block a URL, proxies often struggle to parse the context of a multi-turn agentic conversation without breaking the application. If Proofpoint can successfully layer its Sigma information protection stack on top of Acuvity\u2019s inspection engine, it may be able to offer a \u201ckill switch\u201d for data exfiltration that is context-aware rather than just connection-aware.\nThe \u201cDigital Insider\u201d and the Stakeholder Gap\nThis acquisition also offers Proofpoint a narrative bridge to compete with broader platforms: treating the AI Agent as a \u201cdigital employee.\u201d Proofpoint is an established vendor in Insider Threat Management (ITM). As agents gain autonomy, the risk of an agent \u201cgoing rogue\u201d (hallucinating or being jailbroken) mimics the behavior of a malicious insider. By framing AI security as an extension of ITM, Proofpoint can leverage its large installed base and relationships with CISOs to potentially flank competitors such as Palo Alto Networks or CrowdStrike, despite both companies having made AI-specific acquisitions in the past year.\nHowever, the competitive landscape is far broader. Proofpoint is also contending with pressure from at least four distinct vectors:\n- The Identity & AppSec Incumbents: This is arguably the stiffest headwind. Okta and CyberArk (now a Palo Alto Networks subsidiary) view AI agents as \u201cMachine Identities\u201d that belong under their governance, not Proofpoint\u2019s. Simultaneously, developer-centric platforms like Snyk are moving to secure MCP servers at the code level, while Lakera (now part of Check Point) has traction as an AI firewall that appeals directly to the engineers Proofpoint may struggle to reach.\n- The Email & Human Risk Rivals: Traditional competitors like Abnormal Security and Mimecast (via its acquisition of Aware) are expanding their behavioral detection to cover AI and insider risks, arguing they can secure the \u201chuman element\u201d without a separate agent governance tool.\n- The Network Gatekeepers: Cloud platform providers like F5 and Cloudflare, among others, are actively securing the AI traffic \u201cpipe\u201d via their own gateway offerings, often bundling this for free with existing enterprise contracts.\n- The Data Security Convergence: Proofpoint must compete against dedicated DSPM vendors like Cyera and Wiz, as well as data resilience providers entering the space, including but not limited to IBM, Veeam (via Securiti.ai), and Commvault (via Satori).\nProofpoint\u2019s success will depend on its ability to prove to enterprises that Agent Integrity is not a bottleneck, but the necessary \u201ctrust layer\u201d that finally allows them to move their autonomous agents from pilot to production.\nWho is the right buyer?\nAnother aspect that Proofpoint will have to navigate is engaging the right stakeholders within an organization: Does the CISO make the final decision about agent-based security? Recent data from Futurum\u2019s Cybersecurity Decisionmaker survey, fielded during Q4 2025, shows how, in areas such as data security, which is closely related to AI security, the responsibility for data security is increasingly shared between departments.\nFigure 1: Security Team Influence on Data Security Purchases\nWhat to Watch:\n- Will Proofpoint\u2019s \u201cHuman-Centric\u201d branding survive the pivot to \u201cAgentic\u201d security? As autonomous agents become primary actors, Proofpoint must reconcile its identity with a reality where threats are machine-to-machine.\n- Will this acquisition trigger a defensive consolidation wave among email security rivals? Competitors like Abnormal Security and Mimecast may be forced to build more capabilities around agent governance.\n- Can Proofpoint successfully navigate the shift in buying power to AI engineering teams? As budgets for agentic workflows move away from the traditional CISO, Proofpoint must prove it can sell to the DevOps leaders who may now control the \u201cdigital employee\u201d roadmap.\n- Will Acuvity\u2019s discovery capabilities expose a \u201cShadow Agent\u201d crisis? Just as CASB revealed Shadow IT, early deployments may reveal that employees are already using unmanaged agents, forcing a rapid shift in enterprise security priorities.\nFurther information about the acquisition can be found in Proofpoint\u2019s press release.\nDeclaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted Technologies in the Writing Process: While preparing this work, the author used AI capabilities from both Google Gemini and/or Futurum\u2019s Intelligence Platform to summarize source material and assist with general editing.
