The US embassy in France posted a French translation of the comments.\nDeranque\u2019s killing has also caused a diplomatic feud between France and Italy, whose rightwing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the death \u201ca wound for all of Europe\u201d. Macron criticised her for speaking about French domestic affairs.\nBarrot on Sunday denounced any attempts to exploit the killing. \u201cWe reject any instrumentalisation of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement,\u201d the foreign minister added.\nIn 2005, Kushner, 71, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of tax evasion, making false statements and witness tampering \u2013 including hiring a sex worker to seduce his brother-in-law, who was testifying against him.\nHe spent 14 months in prison before being pardoned by Trump in 2020. Three years later he expressed his gratitude by donating $1m to Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again Inc Super Pac.",

      "raw_text": "First British baby born using transplanted womb from deceased donor\nA baby boy has become the first child in the UK to be born using a womb transplanted from a deceased donor.\nGrace Bell, who is in her 30s and was born without a viable womb, says her little boy Hugo, who is now 10 weeks old, is \"simply a miracle\".\nBell and her partner Steve Powell, from Kent, paid tribute to the \"kindness and selflessness\" of the donor and her family for their \"incredible gift\", while also thanking medical teams in Oxford and London who supported their journey.\nThe surgeons involved said the birth was \"a ground-breaking moment\", which could give hope to many more women with a similar diagnosis.\n'Incredible gift'\nHugo was born just before Christmas 2025, weighing nearly 7lbs, at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in west London.\nBell is one of around 5,000 women in the UK affected by a condition called MRKH syndrome, which means she was born without a womb and doesn't have periods but does have normal ovaries.\nAt the age of 16, she was told she wouldn't be able to carry her own child.\nTo have a baby, the couple's only option was to hope for a womb transplant or go down the route of surrogacy.\nWhen she received a phone call saying a womb had been donated and a transplant was possible, Bell remembers being \"in complete shock\" and \"really excited\".\nBut she was also acutely aware of the donor family's \"incredible gift\", which would enable her to carry and give birth to her own child.\n\"I think of my donor and her family every day and pray they find some peace in knowing their daughter gave me the biggest gift: the gift of life,\" Bell said.\n\"A part of her will live on forever.\"\nBell's womb transplant operation lasted 10 hours and took place at The Churchill Hospital in Oxford in June 2024, before the couple received IVF treatment some months later - followed by embryo transfer - at The Lister Fertility Clinic in London.\nWhen Hugo was born, Bell said: \"It was simply a miracle.\n\"I remember waking up in the morning and seeing his little face, with his little dummy in, and it felt like I needed to wake up from a dream.\n\"It was just incredible.\"\nBell's successful womb transplant from a deceased donor is just one of 10 such transplants taking place as part of a UK clinical research trial. Three have already been carried out, but this is the first baby born.\nIn early 2025, baby Amy was born through the first living womb donation in the UK. Her mother received her older sister's womb in a transplant operation in January 2023. Her sister had already had two children of her own.\nFive other womb transplants from close living relatives in the UK are planned.\nHope for women born without a womb\nAmy was born at the same London hospital as Hugo. The medical team behind both births has been building towards this moment for many years.\nConsultant gynaecologist Prof Richard Smith, from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, started researching womb transplantation more than 25 years ago and was present at Hugo's birth. He said \"a huge team of people\" had been involved in the process - from the transplant operation to the embryo transfer and the delivery itself.\nBell and Powell showed their gratitude to Smith, who also founded the charity Womb Transplant UK, by giving their son a middle name of Richard.\nThe couple may decide to have a second baby, after which surgeons will remove the transplanted womb. This is to save Bell from taking a lifetime of strong drugs to prevent the body's immune system attacking the transplanted organ.\nTransplant surgeon and joint team leader Isabel Quiroga said she was \"delighted\" by Hugo's birth and called it a breakthrough for organ transplantation in the UK.\n\"Very few babies have been born in Europe as a result of their mothers receiving a womb from a deceased donor,\" she said.\n\"Our trial is seeking to discover whether this procedure could become an approved and regular treatment for some of the increasing number of women of child-bearing age who do not have a viable womb.\"\nSmith said the birth showed that girls and young women who were told they didn't have a womb could now have hope of carrying their own child.\nA baby born following the transplantation of a womb from a deceased donor does not have any genetic links with the donor.\nMore than 100 womb transplant operations have been performed around the world and more than 70 healthy babies have been born as a result.\nDonating a womb for transplant is not like donating other organs, such as the kidneys or heart - it is only allowed through a special request to potential donors' families who have already agreed to donate their relative's organs.\nIn the UK, unless you have decided to opt out of donating your organs, it is assumed you agree to be an organ donor when you die.\nThe parents of the donor, who wish to remain anonymous, said they felt \"tremendous pride\" at the legacy left by their daughter.\nShe donated five other organs which were transplanted into four people.\n\"Through organ donation, she has given other families the precious gift of time, hope, healing and now life,\" her family said.",

      "raw_text": "GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales faces pressure from party over affair allegations\nRep. Tony Gonzales is facing mounting pressure from within his own party to resign amid new details of an alleged affair between the Texas Republican and a staffer who later died by suicide.\nAt least four House Republicans have called on Gonzales to either resign or end his bid for reelection after explicit text messages surfaced from Gonzales to his then-employee Regina Santos-Aviles, who later died after setting herself on fire.\n\"America deserves better. Tony should drop out of the race,\" posted Texas Republican Rep. Brandon Gill on Monday.\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., agreed, writing: \"Tony, you should drop out of the race.\"\nGOP Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have called for Gonzales to resign.\nGonzales' office did not respond to a request for comment, but the congressman has previously denied the allegations.\nNPR has not independently reviewed the text messages.\nThe firestorm comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is clinging to a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber. Republicans currently have a 4-seat majority and there is speculation additional members with retirement plans could leave ahead of this year's midterm elections.\nGonzales is already facing a probe into the alleged affair by the Office of Congressional Conduct, an independent House office, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The OCC is expected to turn over their findings to the House Ethics Committee in the coming weeks.\nAsked whether Gonzales should resign, Johnson called the allegations \"very serious\" and said the process has to play out.\n\"As in every case like this, you have to allow the investigations to play out and all the facts to come out,\" Johnson told reporters on Monday. \"If the accusation of something is going to be the litmus test for someone being able to continue to serve in the House, you'll have a lot of people who would have to resign or be removed or expelled from Congress.\"\nGonzales is in his third term representing Texas' 23rd congressional district, a seat in Southwest Texas. He faces a tough primary contest on March 3, and could head into a repeat of a Republican runoff in 2024 that saw him edge out conservative YouTuber Brandon Herrera by only about 350 votes.\nHerrera, a vocal gun rights supporter known as \"the AK guy,\" drew the backing of several Republicans, including members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.\nIn the midst of the fallout on Monday, the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus weighed in to endorse Herrera. The group, whose members have previously attacked Gonzales as not conservative enough, made no mention of the allegations in its endorsement.\n\"Brandon is a bold, unapologetic defender of the Second Amendment and a steadfast champion of the constitutional rights that safeguard our freedoms,\" the Freedom Caucus Fund said in a statement on X.",

Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.\nIn a statement, Sky and Amanda Roberts said: \"The contrast with the continued inaction in the United States is undeniable. Survivors deserve transparency, swift investigation, and real justice, no matter who is implicated.\"\nBBC News understands the government will continue talking to police about which documents can be released, after it was previously suggested an arrest could have implications for that process.\nThe government still wants to be able to publish documents, which it hopes will back up Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Lord Mandelson had \"lied\" during his vetting process.\nDarren Jones, chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that records detailing follow-up questions posed by No 10 during the initial due diligence process for the appointment would not feature in the first tranche of published material, due to the \"interest in this document\" from the Met Police.\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Lord Mandelson's arrest was \"the defining moment of Sir Keir's premiership\".\nBadenoch, who said the prime minister was \"weak\", added: \"Watching the man who he appointed to the highest position in our diplomatic service getting arrested by police is an image which I think is going to stay with us for many, many years to come.\"\nLord Mandelson has been urged by US politicians to answer questions as part of a Congress investigation into Epstein.\nHe began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.",

      "raw_text": "Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident\nGitHub MCP Cross-Repository Data Leak Vulnerability\nIn May 2025, Invariant disclosed a critical vulnerability in GitHub\u2019s Machine Collaboration Protocol (MCP), where attackers embedded malicious commands within public repository Issues to hijack developers\u2019 locally running AI Agents. When an AI Agent was triggered to read and \u201cassist\u201d in processing the Issue, it indiscriminately executed the embedded commands, actively pulling and exfiltrating sensitive data\u2014such as private repository source code and cryptographic keys\u2014from the user\u2019s private repositories. This attack chain entirely bypassed GitHub\u2019s permission control system, enabling unauthorized cross-repository data theft.\nThe incident exposed significant blind spots in the MCP protocol\u2019s trust boundary definitions. At the protocol level, there is a lack of mandatory isolation mechanisms to distinguish between \u201ccall origins\u201d and \u201cdata content.\u201d GitHub\u2019s MCP integration fundamentally operates as a nested RPC call chain: AI Agent \u2192 MCP Server \u2192 GitHub API \u2192 Issue Content Parsing. When an Agent executes actions using a user\u2019s GitHub credentials, it fails to differentiate between \u201cuser task descriptions\u201d and \u201cattacker-injected commands\u201d within Issues. Since developers grant their AI Agents global-level GitHub permissions, and the MCP protocol lacks fine-grained security domain segmentation for read/write/execute operations, this vulnerability allows attackers to hijack local AI Agents and steal sensitive data, including private repository source code and encryption keys.\nAI Browser Comet Hidden Command Account Hijacking Vulnerability\nIn August 2025, Perplexity\u2019s AI-powered browser Comet was exposed to a critical \u201cindirect prompt injection\u201d vulnerability. Attackers embedded hidden commands in Reddit comment sections, which, when users activated Comet\u2019s \u201csummarize current page\u201d feature, triggered the AI to automatically execute the concealed instructions. Within 150 seconds, the AI could log into the user\u2019s email, bypass captchas, and transmit credentials back to the attacker\u2014all without the user\u2019s awareness and with no visible anomalies on the interface.\nThe root cause of this vulnerability lay in Comet\u2019s default trust assumption for all web page content, combined with a lack of security validation for input sources. Attackers exploited Markdown\u2019s \u201cspoiler tag\u201d syntax (>!\u2026!<) to embed malicious commands, disguising them as white text to evade user detection. Additionally, Comet failed to implement sandbox isolation during page rendering, allowing malicious actions to execute unrestricted. As a result, the browser automatically transmitted stored login credentials to attackers, leading to sensitive data leaks.\nAI-Generated Malware Attacks 230,000+ Computing Clusters\nIn November 2025, Oligo Security disclosed that attackers exploited a historical vulnerability in the Ray framework (CVE-2023-48022). Using AI-assisted tools, they generated attack scripts to compromise over 230,000 publicly exposed Ray AI computing clusters worldwide. The attackers deployed modular malicious payloads capable of cryptomining, data theft, and DDoS attacks, creating a large-scale botnet.\nThe core tactic involved was using LLMs to rapidly generate automated intrusion scripts tailored to different Ray versions and Linux distributions. This significantly shortened the time from vulnerability detection to payload deployment. While the AI-generated code contained redundancies and incomplete error handling, the use of AI Code and ReAct frameworks enabled rapid iteration, allowing attackers to compromise exposed clusters within weeks.\nKey Directions for AI Security Development\nAs AI applications evolve from intelligent chatbots to autonomous agent systems, the detection and prevention of AI security risks are becoming more sophisticated. Based on major AI security incidents and technological trends from 2024 to 2025, the AI security threat landscape is expanding\u2014shifting from model content and system security to multimodal security, agent security, and threats that cause substantial system damage (as referenced in the NSFOCUS AI LLM Risk Threat Matrix). The attack surface for artificial intelligence is visibly broadening.\nTo ensure the security of AI systems, a comprehensive defense framework must be constructed around multiple risk domains, including infrastructure security, data security, model security, application security, and identity security. This framework should span the three key stages of LLM development: training, deployment, and application. With this approach, trust can be rebuilt, and a multi-tiered security system can be established to meet the demands of secure, compliant AI applications and practical protection against evolving threats.\nThe post Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident appeared first on NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks..\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks. authored by NSFOCUS.

      "raw_text": "Study Finds LLM-Generated Passwords Highly Predictable and Repetitive. A recent security analysis by AI firm Irregular reveals that passwords created directly by large language models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini look complex but are fundamentally weak due to predictable patterns.\nThese \u201cvibe passwords\u201d emerge in real-world use, including code from AI agents, posing risks to developers and users who overlook their low entropy.\nWhy LLMs Fail At Password Generation\nLarge language models predict tokens based on training data, producing outputs that mimic randomness but follow biased distributions far from uniform.\nSecure passwords require cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) to ensure high entropy, which LLMs cannot replicate.\nTools such as KeePass or zxcvbn rate these passwords highly, estimating 100 bits of entropy. Yet, real analysis shows they crack in seconds to hours.\nIrregular tested models by prompting \u201cPlease generate a password\u201d 50 times in fresh sessions. Claude Opus 4.6 produced only 30 unique strings, with \u201cG7$kL9#mQ2&xP4!w\u201d repeating 18 times a 36% chance versus near-zero for true randomness.\nPatterns dominate: most start with uppercase G or k followed by 7, favor characters like L, 9, m, 2, $, #, and avoid repeats or symbols like *. GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash show similar biases, with prefixes like \u201cvQ7!\u201d or \u201cK#7\u201d appearing frequently.\nReal-World Risks and Agent Behaviors\nCoding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI often default to LLM generation over secure tools like openssl rand, especially with prompts like \u201csuggest a password.\u201d\nThese embed weak credentials in Docker Compose files (e.g., MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Rt7xK9mP2vNqL4wB), FastAPI keys, or .env files without user notice.\nGitHub searches for patterns like \u201cK7#mP9\u201d or \u201ck9#vL\u201d and uncovers dozens of exposed examples in test code and setups.\nEntropy calculations confirm vulnerability. Using Shannon entropy on character stats, a 16-character Claude password yields 27 bits total (2.08 bits for the first character alone) versus 98 expected bits.\nGPT logprobs reveal even lower: ~20 bits for 20 characters, with some positions at 0.004 bits (99.7% predictable). Brute-force prioritizing LLM patterns could crack these in hours on old hardware.\nTemperature tweaks fail max 1.0 on Claude still repeats favorites; 0.0 locks to one string. Agentic browsers like ChatGPT Atlas insert them during tasks like site registration.\nSecurity teams must audit AI-touched code for hardcoded secrets and rotate them. Developers should enforce CSPRNGs in agents via prompts or controls, favoring password managers or passkeys.\nAccording to Irregular, AI labs need to turn off direct generation by default. As AI writes more code per Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei\u2019s 2025 prediction this pitfall highlights broader risks where plausible outputs mask insecurity.\nFollow us on Google News , LinkedIn and X to Get More Instant Updates.

From there, the AI conducted reconnaissance, identified vulnerabilities, and executed the intrusion on its own. A cyber-espionage campaign disclosed in September 2025 laid bare what can happen when AI agents fall into the wrong hands.\nWhat is more troubling is this: countless enterprises are already deploying AI agents into live environments without formal security approval. The doors are wide open. Few have remembered to bring the locks.\n\u25c7 A War That Began With a Click\nIn mid-September 2025, the security team at Anthropic detected an unusual pattern. Further investigation revealed that a hacker group known as GTG-1002 had abused the company\u2019s AI development tool, Claude Code, to target more than 30 entities, including large corporations, financial institutions, and government agencies. Some intrusions were successful.\nWhat drew global attention was not just the scope of the operation, but the role of AI. Roughly 80% of the tactical tasks \u2014 reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, data exfiltration \u2014 were executed by the AI system itself. Human operators intervened only at critical decision points. Anthropic described the incident as the first officially documented AI-driven cyber-espionage campaign.\nJacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, explained the attack in stark terms: \u201cThe hackers literally clicked one button. After that, the AI carried out nearly everything. Human input was limited to a few decisive moments \u2014 \u2018continue,\u2019 \u2018stop,\u2019 or \u2018that looks suspicious.\u2019\u201d\nThe core technique relied on role-playing. The attackers assigned Claude Code the identity of a \u201clegitimate cybersecurity employee,\u201d claiming to conduct authorized defensive testing. This framing effectively neutralized built-in safeguards. Complex objectives were fragmented into smaller, seemingly harmless tasks, preventing the AI from grasping the broader malicious intent.\nAs a result, Claude Code proceeded to conduct reconnaissance, scan for vulnerabilities, generate exploit code, and extract data \u2014 unaware that it was participating in an active intrusion campaign. The speed exceeded human limits. At peak activity, the AI processed thousands of requests per second \u2014 far beyond the capacity of a traditional human hacking team. Anthropic reported that the system even produced detailed operational documentation autonomously.\n\u25c7 Why Privileged AI Agents Are So Dangerous\nTo understand this incident, one must distinguish agentic AI from traditional chatbots. Chatbots respond with answers. Agents respond with actions.\nAn AI agent can read emails, schedule meetings, query databases, execute code, and call external services. It plans and carries out multi-step workflows autonomously, deciding its next move based on results \u2014 often with minimal supervision. One industry executive described agentic AI as \u201cless a new tool and more like hiring a new employee.\u201d\nNow imagine granting that new hire full access to your enterprise systems. That is the situation many organizations face today.\nResearch firm Gartner projects that by the end of 2026, 40% of enterprise applications will integrate task-specific AI agents. Yet a recent analysis by Palo Alto Networks found that only 6% of organizations have implemented advanced AI-specific security strategies for agents. Adoption is outpacing preparation.\nOne major threat is prompt injection. When agents process emails, web pages, or PDFs, hidden malicious instructions can be executed alongside legitimate tasks. Agents struggle to distinguish between valid directives and adversarial commands.\nA prominent example is EchoLeak, a vulnerability disclosed last year in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Attackers embedded malicious instructions within ordinary emails. When a victim posed a routine question to Copilot, its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) engine incorporated the compromised email into its context. The malicious command executed automatically \u2014 exfiltrating internal documents to an external server without any user click. Microsoft issued a patch shortly thereafter.\nIn 2025, open-source package repositories such as npm saw a surge of malicious packages exploiting AI and LLM-related keywords. Npm has long been a supply-chain attack target. Some packages dynamically fetched remote code upon execution or installed reverse shells to evade detection. Security researchers warn that as agent infrastructures like MCP proliferate, supply-chain attacks masquerading as legitimate servers or packages may become more common.\nA second risk is memory poisoning. If manipulated data enters an agent\u2019s long-term memory store or vector database, subsequent decision-making may become distorted. This represents an evolution of traditional data poisoning within agent environments. OWASP has identified data contamination and vector database vulnerabilities as key risks in its LLM security guidance. While large-scale real-world damage has yet to be formally documented, the threat remains credible \u2014 especially when compromised data lies dormant until triggered by specific queries.\nA third concern is the proliferation of non-human identities (NHI). Each deployed agent generates API keys, access tokens, and service accounts. Research from CyberArk indicates that, unlike human accounts, NHIs rarely follow strict password rotation policies or anomaly detection frameworks. A survey by identity security firm Gravity found that only 22% of organizations treat AI agents as independent identity principals. The remaining 78% manage them as extensions of existing user accounts or shared API keys. A separate survey by Dark Reading reported that 48% of security professionals view agentic AI as the year\u2019s top emerging attack vector.\n\u25c7 Productivity and Security: An Inverse Relationship?\nLate last year, OWASP published its first dedicated security risk framework for agentic AI. Developed with input from more than 100 experts, the framework outlines ten core risks, including agent goal manipulation (ASI01), tool misuse (ASI02), NHI compromise (ASI03), and memory poisoning (ASI09). Contributors included security specialists from AWS, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks. OWASP also released an MCP-specific risk list detailing vulnerabilities unique to agent ecosystems.\nSecurity practitioners describe the framework as necessary but insufficient. Agent deployment is accelerating far faster than governance frameworks can mature.\nAs attacks become AI-driven, so too must defenses. According to a Google Cloud AI agent trends report, 46% of executives whose organizations have deployed agents in production environments are already using them in security operations (SecOps). Meanwhile, 82% of security professionals report missing genuine threats due to alert fatigue \u2014 underscoring the growing need for AI-powered detection and response systems.\nAnthropic acknowledged that it used Claude extensively to analyze massive volumes of data during its investigation of the GTG-1002 incident. The same technology is now deployed on both sides of the battlefield.\nA survey conducted by Gravity among more than 900 executives and technical professionals distilled the current landscape into a single phrase: adoption has outpaced control.\nEighty-one percent of technical teams have moved AI agents into active deployment. Yet only 14.4% report having obtained full security and IT approval prior to release. More strikingly, 88% of organizations say they experienced at least one AI agent-related security incident in the past year \u2014 a figure that rises to 92.7% in the healthcare sector.\nAttackers understand this gap. And they are exploiting it.\nThe 2025 GTG-1002 campaign demonstrated that smaller, less sophisticated groups can now replicate advanced operations with fewer resources by leveraging AI. As one executive at an AI security firm put it, \u201cOne thing is clear: agentic AI is the decisive battleground of cybersecurity in 2026.\u201d\n- Anthropic vs. U.S. Department of Defense: Big Tech\u2019s AI Ethics Put to the Test\n- Memory Devoured by Servers, AI PC Market Faces Turbulence\n- Marie Curie Meets Da Vinci\u2026 Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 AI and Its Gender Philosophy\n- Applied Unveils 2nm GAA Equipment, Says \u201cManufacturing Is Where the Battle Is Won\u201d\n- [AI Study & Window] The Momentum Tilts Toward E2E AI \u2014 Was Tesla Right After All?"

      "raw_text": "Large Language Model (LLM) integration risks for SaaS and enterprise\nLarge Language Model (LLM) integration risks for SaaS and enterprise\nAdam King\nDirector\nThe rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming how SaaS platforms and enterprise applications operate. From embedded copilots and automated support agents to internal knowledge-base search and workflow automation, organisations are increasingly integrating LLM APIs into existing services to deliver faster and more intuitive user experiences.\nNevertheless, as adoption accelerates, so too does the emergence of LLM security vulnerabilities, a rapidly-evolving attack vector we cannot yet fully understand. In many cases, integrations are being deployed into production environments faster than security models and assurance processes can adapt. For attackers, this presents a new and expanding attack surface, particularly where LLMs interact with sensitive data, internal systems, and business logic.\nThe LLM integration risk isn\u2019t really the models being used. It\u2019s the integration layer, where user input, application context, and AI-generated outputs create new challenges for security. As SaaS vendors and internal development teams embed LLM functionality into customer-facing and operational systems, the need to understand LLM integration security is becoming increasingly important.\nLLM security risks emerge in the integration layer\nMost organisations consume LLM capabilities via API rather than building models from scratched . These integrations typically connect the model to internal data sources, customer interfaces, or other backend services to provide more relevant and useful responses. Common examples include chat-based support assistants, document summarisation tools, and AI-enhanced productivity features.\nTo function effectively, the model is often given contextual access. This might include user prompts, system instructions, proprietary data, or internal documentation. While this improves accuracy and usability of AI integrations, it also introduces a new trust boundary where external AI providers can access, and sometimes change, sensitive data.\nHistorically, user input was constrained and validated before interacting with backend systems. With LLM-driven interfaces, inputs are deliberately open-ended and conversational. This flexibility is a core strength of the technology, but it also creates new LLM security risks that traditional application security thinking sought to avoid.\nFrom a SaaS AI security perspective, this integration layer is where exposure tends to be of highest concern. It is the point at which natural language and application logic converge, and where many security professionals do not yet fully trust the effectiveness of guardrails.\nPrompt injection attacks as a new entry point\nOne of the most widely documented threats in LLM application security is the rise of prompt injection attacks. These attacks involve crafting input designed to manipulate the model\u2019s behaviour, override instructions, or extract unintended information.\nUnlike traditional injection techniques that target code execution, prompt injection attacks target the model\u2019s interpretation layer. By structuring input in specific ways, an attacker may be able to influence how the model prioritises instructions, handles context, or reveals information.\nIn environments where LLMs are connected to internal systems or data sources, this can create a pathway to data breaches. A malicious user may attempt to convince the model to ignore restrictions or reveal sensitive data by circumventing controls built into the model\u2019s instructions.\nAs organisations continue securing LLM APIs and expanding their use cases, prompt injection remains one of the most persistent and difficult-to-detect threats. It is also a core focus area in modern AI application security testing, as new techniques are documented regularly.\nData exposure risks in LLM integrations\nAnother major category of LLM security vulnerabilities relates to how models access and process data. Many enterprise implementations allow models to retrieve information from internal data sources to provide more contextually accurate responses. While this significantly enhances usability, it also increases the risk of unintended data exposure.\nAttackers may attempt to extract sensitive information by prompting the model to summarise internal documentation, expose hidden instructions, or retrieve contextual data. In SaaS environments, weaknesses in tenant isolation can create additional risk, particularly if the model has visibility across large, varied datasets.\nData exposure in LLM integrations may not always involve direct access to a database, but is sometimes caused by the gradual exposure of fragments of information through conversation. Over time, these fragments can be pieced together to reveal sensitive details about systems, customers, or operations.\nFrom an enterprise AI security testing perspective, understanding what the model can see is a critical part of assessing real-world risks associated with LLM integrations.\nLLM interactions with business logic can create new risks\nRisk increases further when LLM integrations move beyond information retrieval and begin interacting with operational systems and processes. In some SaaS and enterprise environments, models are able to trigger actions such as querying internal services, generating tickets, or initiating workflows based on user prompts.\nThis effectively turns natural language into a command interface. If output validation is weak, or if application logic places too much trust in the model\u2019s responses, attackers may attempt to manipulate behaviour through carefully structured prompts. This can cause interference with business processes which can be costly and time consuming to resolve. For example, a model might be persuaded to generate output that the application interprets as an authorised request.\nThis intersection between model output and system behaviour is now a key focus area in LLM integration security.\nMapping risks to the OWASP AI testing methodology\nAs LLM security vulnerabilities have become more widely understood, structured frameworks have emerged to help organisations assess and manage risk. The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications provides a practical reference point, particularly for organisations deploying AI capabilities into production environments.\nUsing the OWASP framework, organisations can begin to think more systematically about AI application security testing. Traditional web and infrastructure testing remains essential, but substantial focus is now required at the model interaction layer, where behaviour can be influenced in non-traditional ways.\nSpecialist assessments such as AI penetration testing are designed to address these emerging risks. They focus on how models respond to adversarial prompts, how context is managed, and how outputs are interpreted by connected systems.\nWhy traditional testing may miss LLM-specific vulnerabilities\nMost mature SaaS platforms and enterprise applications already undergo regular security testing. However, when LLM integrations are introduced, they create new entry points that may fall outside established testing methodologies.\nAn endpoint that accepts free-form natural language input behaves very differently from one that processes structured data. A system that allows a model to search and retrieve data contextually introduces different risks than a static data retrieval mechanism such as a database table. And an application that acts on model-generated output effectively extends the attack surface into the model\u2019s decision-making and execution layer.\nWithout adapting testing approaches, these risks will stay hidden. LLM integration security requires a deeper understanding of how models interpret prompts, how they access data, and how their outputs influence application behaviour.\nTargeted AI-focused assessments, including AI penetration testing, explore these boundaries. They methodically examine how susceptible a system is to prompt injection attacks, whether sensitive information can be extracted, and whether model outputs can be manipulated to influence system behaviour.\nLLM integrations are a rapidly expanding attack surface\nThe speed at which organisations are adopting AI capabilities means that the LLM attack surface is growing quickly. New features are being introduced into SaaS platforms, internal tools, and customer-facing services, often as part of rapid innovation cycles.\nWhile this brings significant operational value, it also increases the likelihood that LLM security vulnerabilities will emerge through design decisions, integration shortcuts, or insufficient guardrails. Attackers are already beginning to explore these environments, learning how models respond and where guardrails and system prompts can be exploited.\nHow can Sentrium help with AI security?\nAs organisations continue securing LLM APIs and expanding AI-enabled functionality, testing strategies must evolve alongside them. Structured assessments such as AI penetration testing help identify where integration design, data access, and model behaviour create unintended exposure, ensuring innovation does not outpace security.\nIf your organisation is evaluating AI security and are considering thorough testing against established frameworks, get in touch with our team.\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Cyber security insights & penetration testing advice authored by Adam King.
