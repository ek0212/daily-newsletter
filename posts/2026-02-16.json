      "raw_text": "Concerns over autocracy in the U.S. continue to grow\nAs the United States heads toward the midterm elections, there are growing concerns among some political scientists that the country has moved even further along the path to some form of autocracy.\nStaffan I. Lindberg, the director of Sweden's V-Dem Institute, which monitors democracy across the globe, says the U.S. has already crossed the threshold and become an \"electoral autocracy.\"\nSteven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, agrees.\n\"I would argue that the United States in 2025-26 has slid into a mild form of competitive authoritarianism,\" Levitsky said. \"I think it's reversible, but this is authoritarianism.\"\nUnder competitive authoritarianism, countries still hold elections, but the ruling party uses various tactics \u2014 attacking the press, disenfranchising voters, weaponizing the justice system and threatening critics \u2014 to tilt the electoral playing field in its favor.\nLevitsky cited what he considers two strikingly autocratic moments that occurred in September. First, the Trump administration threatened ABC's parent company, Disney, following Jimmy Kimmel's comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, warned.\nA week later, President Trump proposed that U.S. generals use American cities as training grounds for their troops.\n\"We're under invasion from within,\" Trump said to a gathering of military brass in Quantico, Virginia. \"No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms.\"\nLevitsky said this is the kind of language dictators in South America used in the 1970s \u2014 leaders like Augusto Pinochet in Chile.\nA smaller number of scholars reject the portrayal of Trump as a would-be autocrat. They say he is expanding executive power to address the excesses of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.\nJonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, says Trump is pressuring news organizations and universities to address problems with liberal bias.\n\"There are legitimate objections that have been raised by the Trump administration,\" said Turley, the author of Rage and the Republic. \"That does not justify some of the means, but there is a long-standing need for a debate within these institutions.\"\nOther political scientists say the U.S. system of government is battered but still democratic. Kurt Weyland, who researches democracy and authoritarianism at the University of Texas at Austin, says he's increasingly confident that the U.S. can withstand Trump's sweeping attempt to expand executive power.\nWeyland said that for the first months of his second term, Trump was like a \"steamroller\" and faced little containment or opposition. But Weyland, who wrote Democracy's Resilience to Populism's Threat: Countering Global Alarmism, says that has changed.\nFor instance, Kimmel was yanked off the air but soon returned and continues to routinely mock Trump. Weyland also said the president's attempt to tilt the electoral playing field through mass redistricting hasn't worked out as he might have hoped.\n\"If the guy had succeeded in seriously skewing [future] elections in the House, that would've gone to the core of democracy,\" said Weyland, \"but he didn't. He got barely anything.\"\nWeyland also said federal agents shooting two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month was disastrous for the president. Border czar Tom Homan said last week that the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota is ending. Weyland thinks the public blowback to the killings limits Trump's ability to deploy such aggressive tactics going forward.\nThe next big test for American democracy could come in November's midterms. The Trump administration is suing states to hand over voter data, which worries Kim Scheppele, a Princeton University sociologist who has studied the authoritarian tactics of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\nIn 2014, Orb\u00e1n's government messaged Hungarian voters living in the United Kingdom to go to one polling place and then switched to a different location on Election Day.\n\"They disenfranchised almost all the Hungarians in the U.K., most of whom were oppositional to Orb\u00e1n,\" says Scheppele.\nThis month, Steve Bannon, a close Trump ally, proposed that the administration deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to polling places to root out undocumented migrants trying to vote \u2014 which is statistically rare.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she'd never heard the president discuss such a plan \u2014 and federal law prohibits it.\nBut Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, worries that such a move would drive down participation by people of color and naturalized citizens who fear harassment by ICE. If ICE were deployed, Nyhan hopes it would spark even more people to vote.\n\"But even contemplating that kind of interference is, I think, a really substantial threat,\" said Nyhan. \"The way Election Day works in this country, there are no do-overs.\""

      "raw_text": "Bondi criticised after saying all Epstein files have been released\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient.\nA letter sent to members of the US Congress on Saturday from US Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy said all documents held by the DoJ had been released. It contained a list of names appearing in the files.\nKentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.\nMillions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the DoJ earlier this month. At the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released.\nThis was due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations, said Todd Blanche on the day of the documents dump.\nIn the latest letter, Bondi and Blanche wrote: \"In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all 'records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department' that 'relate to' any of nine different categories.\"\nNo records were withheld from the DoJ's release \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity\", the letter added.\nThe individuals listed in the letter include people who \"are or were a government official or politically exposed person\", and whose name appeared at least once in the files, the letter says.\nThe names appear in the files in a \"wide variety of contexts\", including some people who had \"extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell\" and others who were merely referenced in documents or news articles contained in the files, Blanche and Bondi wrote.\nDonald Trump, Bill Gates, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and Bill Clinton - who are included in the list - all had documented past relationships with Epstein and Maxwell. There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and each has denied any involvement in Epstein's crimes.\nBut the list also includes the names of deceased musicians Janis Joplin and Elvis Presley.\nThe letter was addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dick Durbin, as well as the House Judiciary Committee's chairman Jim Jordan and ranking member Jamie Raskin.\nIn an interview on ABC This Week on Sunday, Massie argued that, even though the DoJ \"wants to say they are done with this document production\", there are more crucial files that should be released.\nThe DoJ was \"signing deliberative process privilege in order not to release some of the documents\", he said.\n\"The problem with that is the bill that Ro Khanna and I wrote says that they must release internal memos and notes and emails about their decisions on whether to prosecute or not prosecute, whether to investigate or not investigate.\"\nIn response to the letter, California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who co-wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, accused the DoJ of \"purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email\".\n\"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,\" Khanna wrote on X on Saturday.\n\"Release the full files,\" he added. \"Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names.\"\nThe BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.\nUS lawmakers previously said files on Epstein were improperly redacted ahead of their release, leading to at least one document being unredacted after their criticism.\nLawyers for Epstein's victims have also said the latest tranche of files included email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified.\nAt the time, the DoJ said mistakes were due to \"technical or human error\" and they had taken down all the flagged files.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

      "raw_text": "Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the U.S. that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.\nIran and the U.S. renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation. The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, U.S. officials have told Reuters.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement, while making clear that may not happen.\n\"No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we're going to try,\" Rubio said.\nIran has threatened to strike U.S. bases in the Middle East if it is attacked by U.S. forces but on Sunday took a conciliatory line.\n\"For the sake of an agreement's durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,\" foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.\n\"Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,\" Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured U.S. economic interests.\nIn 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran.\nOn Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday.\n\"Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we'll see how that turns out,\" Rubio said, without providing further details.\nWhile talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.\nIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi left Tehran for Geneva to take part in the indirect nuclear talks with the U.S. and meet the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and others, his ministry said.\nOpen to compromise\nDeputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signalled Iran's readiness to compromise on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was \"in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal.\"\nThe senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief's statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran's flexibility.\nHowever, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.\nIn June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites.\nThe U.S. is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran's oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.\nChina accounts for more than 80% of Iran's oil exports so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran's oil revenue.\nNetanyahu: Dismantle Iran nuclear infrastructure\nNetanyahu said on Sunday he told U.S. President Donald Trump last week that any U.S. deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.\nSpeaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Netanyahu also said Israel still needs to \"complete the job\" of destroying all tunnels in Gaza. Israel, he said, has already dismantled 150 km (93 miles) of an estimated 500 km.\nNetanyahu said he is skeptical of a U.S. deal with Iran but said it must include enriched material leaving Iran. \"There shall be no enrichment capability \u2014 not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place,\" he said.\nNetanyahu also said that he aimed to end U.S. military aid to Israel within the next 10 years, after the current 10-year deal of receiving $3.8 billion a year \u2014 which is largely spent in the United States on equipment \u2014 ends in 2028.\nDue to a thriving economy, \"we can afford to phase out the financial component of the military aid that we're receiving, and I propose a 10-year drawdown to zero. Now, in the three years that remain in the present memorandum of understanding and another seven years draw it down to zero,\" Netanyahu said.\n\"We want to move with the United States from aid to partnership,\" he said."
