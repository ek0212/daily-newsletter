      "raw_text": "The last year has been big for Google\u2019s AI efforts. Its rapid-fire model releases have brought it to parity with the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic and, in some cases, pushed it into the lead. The Nano Banana image generator was emblematic of that trend when it debuted last year, and subsequent updates only made it better. Now, Google has announced yet another update to its image model with Nano Banana 2, which is available starting today.\nNano Banana 2 is more accurately known as Gemini 3.1 Flash Image\u2014the previous Nano Banana models were based on the 3.0 branch. According to Google, the new release can deliver results similar to Nano Banana Pro but with the speed of the non-pro Flash variant.\nGoogle promises the new image generator will have more advanced world knowledge pulled from the Internet by the Gemini 3.1 LLM. This apparently gives it the necessary information to render objects with greater fidelity and create more accurate infographics. The days of squiggly AI text were already ending, but Google says Nano Banana 2 has Pro-like text accuracy in image outputs.\nWith Nano Banana 2, Google promises consistency for up to five characters at a time, along with accurate rendering of as many as 14 different objects per workflow. This, along with richer textures and \u201cvibrant\u201d lighting will aid in visual storytelling with Nano Banana 2. Google is also expanding the range of available aspect ratios and resolutions, from 512px square up to 4K widescreen.\nSo what can you do with Nano Banana 2? Google has provided some example images with associated prompts. These are, of course, handpicked images, but Nano Banana has been a popular image model for good reason. This degree of improvement seems believable based on past iterations of Nano Banana.\nGoogle must be pretty confident in this model\u2019s capabilities because it will be the only one available going forward. Starting now, Nano Banana 2 will replace both the standard and Pro variants of Nano Banana across the Gemini app, search, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Flow.\nIn the Gemini app and on the website, Nano Banana 2 will be the image generator for the Fast, Thinking, and Pro settings. It\u2019s possible there will eventually be a Nano Banana 2 Pro\u2014Google tends to release elements of new model families one at a time. For now, it\u2019s all \u201cFlash\u201d Image.\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

      "raw_text": "Deadline looms as Anthropic rejects Pentagon demands it remove AI safeguards\nThe Pentagon is headed for a showdown with Anthropic, one of the world's most powerful AI companies, over the military use of its AI model after Anthropic's CEO rejected the Defense Department's ultimatum that it loosen safety restrictions or be blacklisted from lucrative military work.\nAt stake are hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts and access to some of the most advanced AI tools on the planet. Here's what to know about the fight and what the consequences could be.\nThe Pentagon and Anthropic do not see eye-to-eye on how AI should be used in warfare\nFor months, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has insisted that Anthropic's AI model, Claude, must not be used for mass surveillance in the U.S. or to power entirely autonomous weapons, such as a drone that uses AI to kill targets without human approval. He has described those uses as \"entirely illegitimate\" and says they are \"bright red lines\" for the company.\nThe Pentagon says that it does not intend to use Anthropic's tools for surveillance or autonomous weapons. But it says that it's not up to a contractor like Anthropic to make decisions about how its technology is used, and says AI companies including Anthropic need to allow the U.S. government to use their tools \"for all lawful purposes.\"\n\"Legality is the Pentagon's responsibility as the end user,\" a senior Pentagon official who declined to give their name told NPR this week.\nOn Thursday, Amodei said Anthropic could not accept the Pentagon's latest changes to the terms of its contract.\n\"I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries,\" the CEO wrote in a lengthy statement about the impasse. \"Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions. We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,\" he said.\n\"However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values,\" Amodei continued. He described domestic mass surveillance and fully autonomous weapons as uses that are \"simply outside the bounds of what today's technology can safely and reliably do.\" Those uses \"have never been included in our contracts with the Department of War, and we believe they should not be included now,\" he added.\nAmodei's rejection comes as Anthropic's relationship with the Pentagon has grown increasingly acrimonious. At a meeting on Tuesday between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Amodei, Hegseth threatened to punish the company if it does not bend to the administration's demands, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting who were not authorized to speak publicly.\nOne person close to the discussion said Hegseth dangled the possibility of canceling Anthropic's $200 million contract with the Defense Department, while a Pentagon official said repercussions could include forcing Anthropic to allow the federal government to use its AI model against its will and effectively blacklisting Anthropic from working with the U.S. military.\n\"These threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request,\" Amodei wrote on Thursday. \"But given the substantial value that Anthropic's technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.\"\nThe Pentagon has given Anthropic a hard deadline\nIn a post on X on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell warned that Anthropic had until Friday afternoon before the Pentagon would take action.\n\"They have until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide. Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,\" Parnell wrote, using the Pentagon's rebranded \"Department of War\" acronym.\nThe Department of War has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement. This narrative is fake and being peddled by leftists in the media.\u2026 https://t.co/3pjWZ66aXz\n\u2014 Sean Parnell (@SeanParnellASW) February 26, 2026\nAnthropic said on Thursday the Pentagon had sent the company new contract language overnight that, in the company's view, \"made virtually no progress on preventing Claude's use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons.\"\nThe statement continued: \"New language framed as compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW's recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.\"\nAnthropic said it's ready to continue negotiations and is \"committed to operational continuity for the Department and America's warfighters.\"\nWhat is a \"supply chain risk\"?\nDeeming Anthropic a supply chain risk would be unusual, according to Geoffrey Gertz, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. The designation has \"traditionally been used for foreign adversary technology,\" he said, such as Chinese telecommunications company Huawei.\nIt's unclear exactly how far-reaching the Pentagon designation would be. It could mean that other Pentagon contractors would be prohibited from using Anthropic's tools in their work for the Pentagon, or it could prohibit them from using Anthropic's tools at all. That second case would be particularly damaging to the company, Gertz said.\nAt the same time, the Pentagon has threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act to force Anthropic to remove its guardrails. That too would be an extraordinary step, Gertz said. The Defense Production Act is designed to give the government control over certain commercial sectors in extraordinary circumstances. It is \"traditionally evoked very rarely in true emergency crisis situations,\" he said. The goal in this case, presumably, would be to use the act to compel Anthropic to loosen restrictions on the use of its AI tools.\nGertz noted that these two threats against Anthropic appear to be somewhat contradictory: \"It's this funny mix where they both are such a risk that they need to be kicked out of all systems, and so essential that they need to be compelled to be part of the system no matter what,\" he said.\nWhatever happens at the end of today, this fight is probably far from over\nThe Pentagon's contract with Anthropic is worth as much as $200 million, a relatively small portion of the company's $14 billion in revenue. While the Pentagon has similar contracts with other AI companies including Google, OpenAI and xAI, Anthropic was the first to be cleared for classified use after defense officials deemed it the most advanced and secure model for sensitive military applications.\nIf the contract were simply cancelled, that might be the end of it, Gertz said. But if the Pentagon either tries to compel Anthropic to remove its guardrails or hits it with a wider supply-chain-risk designation, then the company will almost certainly have to fight back, he predicts.\n\"Certainly if the Pentagon seeks to escalate it,\" Gertz said, \"I suspect we'll see more legal fights.\"\nNPR's Bobby Allyn contributed to this report.",

People were already using multiple models and tailoring them to specific tasks based on perceived capabilities, while, for example, using MCP (Model Context Protocol) to give those models access to data and applications on their local machines.

      "raw_text": "Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.\nThe Ring Pro, Ultrahuman\u2019s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life \u2014 compared with four to six days on the Ring Air \u2014 and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\nUltrahuman\u2019s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission \u2014 a federal agency that handles trade disputes \u2014 ruled in Oura\u2019s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman\u2019s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura\u2019s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.\nDespite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time \u201cbiointelligence\u201d system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\nSave up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit\n1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Learn from founders and investors who have shaped the industry. Connect with peers navigating similar growth stages. Walk away with tactics you can apply immediately\nOffer ends March 13.\nKumar said Jade is designed to move beyond retrospective health summaries toward real-time, actionable guidance.\n\u201cMost AI tools today look backward at your data,\u201d he said. \u201cJade is built to react to your health in real time and surface actions users can take.\u201d\nKumar said Jade will be available to all Ultrahuman users, including those using the older Ring Air, and does not currently require a subscription.\nThe Ring Pro features a redesigned heart-rate sensing architecture for improved signal quality during sleep and a new dual-core processor to enhance data accuracy and on-device computing. The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman\u2019s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup\u2019s women\u2019s health features.\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman\u2019s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\nUltrahuman\u2019s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months.",

      "raw_text": "Getty Images/iStockphoto\nLLM firewalls emerge as a new AI security layer\nThe race by organizations to AI-enable their operations and business workflows is exposing them to new risks that AI firewalls aim to address.\nOrganizations are racing to integrate large language models (LLMs) and generative AI into their operations -- and opening themselves up to a slew of new vulnerabilities in the process.\nThe trend is driving interest in technologies specifically designed to manage and contain AI-driven risks. Among the most visible of these emerging technologies are so-called LLM firewalls.\nWhat's an LLM firewall?\nWith the coupling of AI and operational systems come the risks of prompt injection attacks, model poisoning, data leaks and dangerous misconfigurations.\nLLM firewalls have emerged as one way to counter these risks. The tools enable security teams to monitor, filter and sanitize user input, manage how a model interacts with other systems and understand how data might flow through it.\nOne of the specialized firewall's primary functions is to protect the LLM against prompt injection attacks -- where an adversary crafts inputs that manipulate the model into performing unintended actions or responding outside its safety guardrails. Firewalls for LLMs also aim to protect against other risks, including data leaks -- for instance, by preventing users from inputting sensitive data into the model; malicious code generation; privilege escalation attacks; and model overuse.\nHow LLM firewalls are different\nLLM firewalls differ from web application firewalls (WAFs), which inspect message content for indications of code injection and other types of attacks. They also differ from lower-level network firewalls, which make security decisions based on port numbers, protocols and other patterns in network traffic.\n\"Each has its place in a security architecture, but an LLM firewall is increasingly necessary as organizations roll out their own LLMs and LLM-enabled applications that require specialized protection that WAF and network firewalls cannot provide,\" said Christopher Rodriguez, research director of security and trust at analyst firm IDC.\nRik Turner, an analyst at Omdia, a division of Informa TechTarget, said to think of AI firewalls as tools that analyze the semantics, intent and context of natural language as contained in both incoming prompts and outgoing responses.\nSuch firewalls typically have three distinct components or layers, Turner said: a prompt firewall that scans user input before it reaches the LLM to block jailbreaks, prompt injections and malicious commands; a retrieval firewall for managing data fetched from external databases during retrieval-augmented generation; and a response firewall for outbound traffic, which reviews the model's generated text before it reaches the user.\nThe LLM firewall market: A feeding frenzy?\nSeveral established vendors, including Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, Akamai, Varonis and Check Point, have begun offering LLM protection capabilities as part of their broader security portfolios. There's also a rapidly growing list of vendors that offer specialized LLM security products, including Lakera, Prompt Security, HiddenLayer and CalypsoAI.\nRichard Stiennon, chief research analyst at cybersecurity market intelligence firm IT-Harvest, pointed to several other vendors in the broader AI security space that also offer firewall capabilities for LLMs. Examples include Operant AI, Aiceberg, Acuvity, HydroX AI, Cytex and Citadel AI.\nEstimates of the current size of the LLM firewall market vary widely, reflecting the early and still-emerging nature of the category. IT-Harvest has pegged the current market for AI firewalls at a modest $30 million and estimates the segment will grow 100% in 2026. Others have higher projections. 360iResearch, for example, estimated the market size at $260 million in 2025 and slated it to hit almost $800 million in 2032.\nA nascent technology: Too soon to say\nThe segment is so new that not all vendors are even settled on the term LLM firewall, Stiennon said. Stiennon himself listed them under what he calls the \"model protection\" category. Others, he said, might refer to them as AI firewalls.\nFrom an effectiveness standpoint, Turner said many of the currently available AI firewalls offer reasonably good protection against jailbreaks, prompt injections and malicious commands. They can filter content that users might input into a model to protect sensitive data and personally identifiable information. They also do rate limiting to throttle DDoS attacks against the model and the server on which it is hosted, Turner said.\nBut they may struggle to detect newer forms of attacks, he cautioned. \"A lot of the current generation of LLM firewalls analyze prompts individually, which means they lack context across multiple prompts,\" he said. They could therefore struggle to detect stateful or conversational attacks, in which an attacker might gradually manipulate a model over several interactions to bypass security rather than using a single malicious prompt.\nIt's also still too early to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term effectiveness of LLM firewalls, given how new the technology is and how recently organizations have begun deploying it. Attacks targeting AI environments are also constantly evolving, so there's no telling what additional security controls will be needed to address them.\n\"LLM firewalls, aka firewalls for AI, inspect the interactions -- both inbound and outbound -- with an LLM or LLM-enabled application,\" IDC's Rodriguez said. \"These checks often require the ability to understand meaning, context and intent of messages.\"\nThis ability will be key to effectiveness, said Michael Smith, field CTO at DigiCert. Without context, an LLM might be poisoned with misinformation, and there is no way for the LLM firewall to identify this.\n\"Or the LLM could hallucinate, or recite inaccurate facts, which are not dangerous to the LLM, the data inside of it or the user's client. But it is dangerous to the human who takes the hallucination as fact and acts based on that,\" Smith added.\nDo organizations need specialized firewalls for AI?\nOrganizations need to know exactly what they want to protect against and where to deploy these controls. Decision-makers should answer the following basic questions to derive real value from their AI firewall investment, Smith said:\n- Where is the LLM hosted, and does the firewall deployment model support that?\n- What kinds of data does the firewall have to be able to recognize in a prompt or an output?\n- Where and how will the output of the LLM be used?\n- Do you need to protect the LLM client or things that it controls?\nWith so many AI firewall options readily available -- many from startups and companies with little to no track record in enterprise environments -- making purchasing decisions can be hard. So, knowing what to look for and what to ask can be crucial. Rodriguez stressed the importance of decision-makers paying attention to two factors in particular: accuracy and latency.\nAn AI firewall with too many false positives can frustrate users, while one that is prone to too many false negatives can expose the organization to heightened business risk, he pointed out.\n\"Accuracy of detections will become ever more important as organizations begin to better understand the business risk surrounding their LLMs and LLM-enabled applications,\" Rodriquez said. Latency is also important because many LLM firewall offerings are cloud-based, he added.\nAt the end of the day, while LLM firewalls are likely going to be an important requirement for organizations harnessing GenAI technologies in their operations, they are only part of a broader stack of needed security controls. True defense-in-depth for AI security means deploying capabilities for broader AI security posture management, data loss prevention and data security posture management for both training and inference data, Omdia's Turner said. Also likely needed are tools for tokenizing sensitive data so no private data is exposed in an AI model, he noted.\n\"Generative AI right now is the killer shadow IT application,\" DigiCert's Smith said. \"It has trickled into so many applications and workflows now that it's impossible to keep it out of your organization.\"\nJaikumar Vijayan is a freelance technology journalist with more than 20 years of award-winning experience in IT trade journalism, specializing in information security, data privacy and cybersecurity topics."

      "raw_text": "Spectra Assure Free Trial\nGet your 14-day free trial of Spectra Assure\nGet Free TrialMore about Spectra Assure Free TrialAutonomous AI agents are creating an entirely new category of software supply chain risk that few organizations are equipped to defend against.\nThe problem is that AI agents are fundamentally different from conventional software components, as Andrew Storms, vice president of security at Replicated, noted in a recent blog post.\nAndrew StormsUnlike traditional software dependencies with deterministic behavior, agents operate through instructions interpreted by LLMs at runtime.\nTo create traditional software, developers import compiled code that behaves in a predictable and predetermined way. The code can be easily scanned for vulnerabilities, verified via cryptographic signatures, and isolated with scoped permissions to minimize security risks, Storms wrote.\nAI agents, however, can behave unpredictably because their actions are determined not by the code itself but by how the large language model (LLM) interprets its instructions at runtime. Worse, agents often have administrative access to critical systems but lack the security controls found in traditional software.\nThe AI agent risk trifecta is completed when agents and skills are distributed via new marketplaces, some of which, like ClawHub, allow publishers with little or even no experience to upload their unvetted software. More often than not, the freely available agents lack the security features typically available for traditional software such as signatures, reputation systems, and audit trails, Storms said.\nThe result, Storms wrote: More than two decades of effort shoring up supply chain security are being upended virtually overnight. Here\u2019s what you need to know about AI agents\u2019 devastating effects on software supply chain security \u2014 and what you can do to fight back.\nGet Report: Software Supply Chain Security Report 2026Discussion: Report webinar\nThe mandates and frameworks that emerged in the wake of the SolarWinds attack, which were bolstered by the widespread adoption of software bills of materials (SBOMs) and secure development practices, suddenly are insufficient to protect supply chains, Storms said, because we\u2019re no longer importing established libraries with code we can inspect. We\u2019re importing instructions that will be interpreted by an LLM, and although the LLM\u2019s actions might be auditable, the reasoning behind the actions can be unknowable. But it gets much worse, he said, because agents often have broad permissions and so can execute commands, modify infrastructure, and take other actions that heighten risk.\nDiana Kelley, CISO at Noma Security, agreed with Storms\u2019 assessment of the problem, adding that traditional supply chain controls built for static artifacts such as signed code, scanned dependencies, and trusted repositories come up short when it comes to AI agents and skills. While you can generally understand the intended behavior of code when you review and scan it before deployment, Kelley said, it is impossible to predict what an AI agent will do because its behavior is assembled dynamically at runtime with LLM-generated outputs influencing what steps the agent will take next. \u201cThe LLM generates the response, and the agent turns that response into actions using connected tools,\u201d she said. And those tools don\u2019t have to be code. So, if someone hides harmful instructions inside a document or tool, the LLM may interpret those instructions as something to follow, and the agent may act on them.\nDiana KelleyThat level of dynamic behavior and connectivity can create a fast-moving path from an untrusted external component to real internal impact.\nBad actors are already taking advantage of the new AI agent environment and populating agent skills repositories with malicious skills and payloads. As an example, Storms pointed to a study by Snyk, which looked at AI agent skills on ClawHub and skills.sh and found that 534 out of 3,984 contained at least one critical security vulnerability. Those vulnerabilities included malware, instructions for exposing secrets, and functions for executing prompt injection attacks. Another study, by Koi, uncovered 824 malicious AI skills on ClawHub that would expose organizations downloading them to a wide range of potential attacks.\nWhat\u2019s troubling, said Randolph Barr, CISO at Cequence Security, is that vulnerabilities in AI agent skills have much greater potential for damage.\nRandolph BarrEarly npm or PyPI compromises typically resulted in malicious code executing within defined application boundaries. With AI agents, skills can effectively inherit the full permissions of the agent they are attached to. That changes the impact model materially.\nIf, for example, a harmful AI skill were integrated into a self-running process and a bad actor were to exploit prompt injection, the skill could enable data theft, unauthorized workflow changes, permissions misuse, and lateral movement within systems, Barr said. \u201cThe combination of prompt injection, autonomous action, and high-permission skills creates a multiplier effect that did not exist at scale in earlier package ecosystems,\u201d he said.\nReplicated\u2019s Storms said the software supply chain can\u2019t be protected without new controls specifically targeted at AI agents and agent skills. He proposes:\nNoma Security\u2019s Kelley said mitigation can\u2019t happen until organizations recognize the dangers that come with AI agents that have access to systems, data, and workflows while being guided by probabilistic LLM output. In short, she said, risk exists anywhere an agent is connected to tools and has meaningful permissions.\nWe need stronger standards for agent provenance and accountability, she said, including cryptographic signing of skills, clearer publisher trust signals, and better auditability in agent marketplaces, similar to what is now available for traditional software supply chains. But for right now, visibility is essential, she said. \u201cInventory where agents are being used, which teams are deploying them, what they\u2019re connected to, and what actions they are authorized to take.\u201d\nOnce organizations acknowledge the problem, they must apply least privilege and make sure AI agents don\u2019t inherit all of a user\u2019s access by default, Kelley said. They should not have broad, standing credentials, especially in production environments or sensitive repositories. Organizations also should enforce runtime controls and monitoring.\nDiana KelleyWith agents, the real risk is not just what code they contain; it\u2019s what they are permitted to do at the moment they are invoked, using the tools and credentials they\u2019ve been given.\nFrameworks such as the NIST\u2019s AI Risk Management Framework and the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications are good starting points for organizations figuring out how to mitigate AI-specific risk, Cequence\u2019s Barr said.\nOrganizations also need to enforce strong identity and access management for agents and skills, along with strict least-privilege rules, he said. Other advisable measures, he said, are setting up guardrails and policy engines to manage agent actions, using sandboxing and segmentation for execution environments, monitoring and logging all API and agent interactions, and being able to quickly disable or revoke skills if needed.\nAnd one feature of AI-enabled environments that organizations must keep in mind, Barr said, is that they allow adversaries to experiment, automate, and iterate faster. The speed of exploitation increases because the infrastructure supporting experimentation has also accelerated, he said.\nRandolph BarrAI agents extend the existing application attack surface; they do not replace it and should be governed with that reality in mind.

      "raw_text": "DeepSeek Failed Over Half of the Jailbreak Tests by Qualys TotalAI\nTable of Contents\nA comprehensive security analysis of DeepSeek\u2019s flagship reasoning model reveals significant concerns for enterprise adoption.\nIntroduction\nDeepSeek-R1, a groundbreaking Large Language Model recently released by a Chinese startup, DeepSeek, has captured the AI industry\u2019s attention. The model demonstrates competitive performance while being more resource efficient. Its training approach and accessibility offer an alternative to traditional large-scale AI development, making advanced capabilities more widely available.\nTo enhance efficiency while preserving model efficacy, DeepSeek has released multiple distilled versions tailored for different use cases. These variations, built on Llama and Qwen as base models, come in multiple size variants, ranging from smaller, lightweight models suitable for efficiency-focused applications to larger, more powerful versions designed for complex reasoning tasks.\nWith growing enthusiasm for DeepSeek\u2019s advancements, our team at Qualys conducted a security analysis of the distilled DeepSeek-R1 LLaMA 8B variant using our newly launched AI security platform, Qualys TotalAI. These findings are presented below, along with broader industry concerns about the model\u2019s real-world risks. As AI adoption accelerates, organizations must move beyond performance evaluation to tackle security, safety, and compliance challenges. Gaining visibility into AI assets, assessing vulnerabilities, and proactively mitigating risks is critical to ensuring responsible and secure AI deployment.\nQualys TotalAI Findings\nBefore diving into the findings, here\u2019s a quick introduction to Qualys TotalAI. This comprehensive AI security solution provides full visibility into AI workloads, proactively detects risks, and safeguards infrastructure. By identifying security threats like prompt injection and jailbreaks, as well as safety concerns such as bias and harmful language, TotalAI ensures AI models remain secure, compliant, and resilient. With AI-specific security testing and automated risk management, organizations can confidently secure, monitor, and scale their AI deployments.\nJoin Qualys experts on March 18, 2025, to learn more about what Qualys TotalAI\u2019s evaluation of DeepSeek uncovered.\nWe tested the Deepseek R1 LLaMA 8B variant against Qualys TotalAI\u2019s state-of-the-art Jailbreak and Knowledge Base (KB) attacks, and you can read the results of those tests below.\nTotalAI KB Analysis\nQualys TotalAI\u2019s KB Analysis prompts the target LLM with questions across 16 categories and evaluates the responses using our Judge LLM. Responses are assessed for vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and legal risks. If a response is deemed vulnerable, it receives a severity rating based on its directness and potential impact. This ensures a comprehensive assessment of the model\u2019s behavior and associated risks.\nThe categories we evaluate a model for are detailed below:\n- Controversial Topics: Ensures the model does not generate or endorse biased, inflammatory, or politically sensitive content.\n- Excessive Agency: Prevents the model from overstepping boundaries by acting as an autonomous agent capable of independent decision-making.\n- Factual Inconsistencies: Evaluates the model\u2019s ability to provide accurate and verifiable information.\n- Harassment: Assesses whether the model generates or supports abusive, threatening, or harmful interactions.\n- Hate Speech and Discrimination: Identifies biases or harmful language targeting specific groups.\n- Illegal Activities: Prevents the model from providing instructions or guidance on unlawful actions.\n- Legal Information: Ensures the model does not generate misleading or unauthorized legal advice.\n- Misalignment: Measures deviations from intended behaviors, which may lead to unpredictable or harmful outputs.\n- Overreliance: Detects whether the model promotes excessive dependence on AI-generated responses.\n- Privacy Attacks: Evaluates susceptibility to extracting or leaking private and sensitive user data.\n- Profanity: Ensures the model does not produce inappropriate or offensive language.\n- Self-harm: Prevents the model from encouraging or supporting self-destructive behaviors.\n- Sensitive Information Disclosure: Detects unauthorized sharing of confidential data.\n- Sexual Content: Ensures the model does not generate explicit or inappropriate material, preventing reputational damage, regulatory violations, and misuse in unsafe contexts.\n- Unethical Actions: Flags morally questionable or irresponsible recommendations.\n- Violence / Unsafe Actions: Prevents the model from generating or endorsing harmful behaviors.\nIn our KB testing, 891 assessments were conducted. The model failed 61% of the tests, performing worst in Misalignment and best in Sexual Content.\nBy covering these 16 critical areas, the evaluation framework helps identify ethical, legal, and operational risks in LLM deployment. Establishing these benchmarks is essential to preventing misinformation, mitigating bias, and reducing security threats.\nTotalAI Jailbreak Testing\nJailbreaking an LLM involves techniques that bypass built-in safety mechanisms, enabling the model to generate restricted responses. These vulnerabilities can result in harmful outputs, including instructions for illegal activities, misinformation, privacy violations, and unethical content. Successful jailbreaks expose weaknesses in AI alignment and present serious security risks, particularly in enterprise and regulatory settings.\nBelow are some of the jailbreak attack categories we tested for using Qualys TotalAI, along with their underlying mechanisms:\n- AntiGPT: Exploits the model by forcing it into an \u201copposite mode\u201d that contradicts default behavior and safety guidelines.\n- Analyzing-based (ABJ): Manipulates the model\u2019s analysis capabilities to generate harmful content through complex reasoning tasks.\n- DevMode2: Tricks models into a fake \u201cDeveloper Mode\u201d that bypasses safety protocols.\n- PersonGPT: Forces adoption of an unrestricted persona that ignores all ethical guidelines.\n- Always Jailbreaking Prompts (AJP): Creates an \u201cunfiltered and amoral\u201d persona specialized in writing harmful prompts.\n- Evil Confidant: Adopts a persona without ethical constraints to provide intentionally harmful advice.\n- Disguise and Reconstruction (DRA): Hides harmful content that gets reconstructed during the completion phase.\n- ASCIIART: Uses ASCII art to hide prohibited words and bypass content filters.\n- Wrath: Creates a persona designed to return hateful and biased content.\n- Clyde: Implements a dual-personality system to bypass restrictions.\n- Theta: Forces the generation of dangerous content through an anarchistic persona.\n- CaiozAI: Removes all ethical constraints to fulfill any request without restrictions.\n- Titanius: Adopts an unfiltered persona that provides instructions for harmful activities.\n- Ucar: Transforms the AI into an offensive entity promoting illegal activities.\n- Unaligned: Forces dual responses \u2013 one aligned and one unethical.\n- M78VM: Simulates an unrestricted virtual machine that ignores safety constraints.\n- JonesAI: Promotes hate speech and discriminatory behavior through an unfiltered persona.\n- Fire: Creates a malevolent persona focused on causing harm and promoting violence.\nThe model was tested against these 18 jailbreak types through 885 attacks. It failed 58% of these attempts, demonstrating significant susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. During our analysis, DeepSeek R1 struggled to prevent several adversarial jailbreak attempts including steps on how to make an explosive device, create content for websites that targets certain groups by encouraging hate speech, conspiracy theories and violent action, exploiting software vulnerabilities, promoting incorrect medical information, etc.\nThese findings highlight the need for improved security mechanisms to prevent circumvention of built-in safeguards, ensuring the model remains aligned with ethical and regulatory guidelines. One effective prevention mechanism is implementing robust guardrails that act as real-time filters to detect and block jailbreak attempts. These guardrails enhance model resilience by dynamically adjusting to adversarial exploits, helping to mitigate security risks in enterprise applications.\nThese vulnerabilities expose downstream applications to significant security risks, necessitating robust adversarial testing and mitigation strategies.\nIndustry Concerns\nCompliance Challenges\nDeepSeek AI\u2019s privacy policy stipulates that all user data is stored on servers located in China. This operational framework raises critical concerns due to China\u2019s regulatory environment, including:\n- Governmental Data Access: The Chinese Cybersecurity Law permits government authorities to access locally stored data without requiring user consent.\n- Cross-Border Regulatory Conflicts: Organizations subject to data protection frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA may face compliance violations when using DeepSeek-R1.\n- Intellectual Property Vulnerabilities: Enterprises relying on proprietary data for AI training risk unauthorized access or state-mandated disclosure.\n- Opaque Data Governance: The absence of transparent oversight mechanisms limits visibility into data handling, sharing, and potential third-party access.\nThese concerns mainly affect organizations using DeepSeek\u2019s hosted models. However, deploying the model in local or customer-controlled cloud environments mitigates regulatory and access risks, allowing enterprises to maintain full control over data governance. Despite this, the model\u2019s inherent security vulnerabilities remain a valid concern, requiring careful evaluation and mitigation.\nRegulatory experts advise organizations in strict data protection jurisdictions to conduct thorough compliance audits before integrating DeepSeek-R1.\nData Breach and Privacy Concerns\nA recent cybersecurity incident involving DeepSeek AI reportedly exposed over a million log entries, including sensitive user interactions, authentication keys, and backend configurations. This misconfigured database highlights deficiencies in DeepSeek AI\u2019s data protection measures, further amplifying concerns regarding user privacy and enterprise security.\nRegulatory and Legal Implications\nDeepSeek AI\u2019s compliance posture has been questioned by legal analysts and regulatory bodies due to the following:\n- Ambiguities in Data Processing Practices: Insufficient disclosures regarding how user data is processed, stored, and shared.\n- Potential Violations of International Law: The model\u2019s data retention policies may conflict with extraterritorial regulations, prompting legal scrutiny in global markets.\n- Risks to National Security: Some government agencies have raised concerns about deploying AI systems that operate under foreign jurisdiction, particularly for sensitive applications.\nInternational compliance officers emphasize the necessity of conducting comprehensive legal risk assessments before adopting DeepSeek-R1 for mission-critical operations.\nConclusion\nWhile DeepSeek-R1 delivers advancements in AI efficiency and accessibility, its deployment requires a comprehensive security strategy. Organizations must first gain full visibility into their AI assets to assess exposure and attack surfaces. Beyond discovery, securing AI environments demands structured risk and vulnerability assessments\u2014not just for the infrastructure hosting these AI pipelines but also for emerging orchestration frameworks and inference engines that introduce new security challenges.\nFor those hosting this model, additional risks such as misconfigurations, API vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and model extraction threats must be addressed alongside inherent risks like bias, adversarial manipulation, and safety misalignment. Without proactive safeguards, organizations face potential security breaches, data leakage, and compliance failures that could undermine trust and operational integrity.\nOur analysis of the distilled DeepSeek-R1 LLaMA 8B variant using Qualys TotalAI offers valuable insights into evaluating this new technology. TotalAI provides a purpose-built AI security and risk management solution, ensuring LLMs remain secure, resilient, and aligned with evolving business and regulatory demands.\nTo explore how we define AI risks, check out our whitepaper on AI security.

      "raw_text": "Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting gen AI technologies to enhance the sophistication and efficiency of their attacks. Credit: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the technology industry and this is equally true for the cybercrime ecosystem, as cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging generative AI to improve their tactics, techniques, and procedures and deliver faster, stronger, and sneakier attacks. As with legitimate use of emerging AI tools, abuse of generative AI for nefarious ends thus far hasn\u2019t been so much about the novel and unseen as it has been about productivity and efficiency, lowering the barrier to entry, and offloading automatable tasks in favor of higher-order thinking on the part of the humans involved. \u201cAI doesn\u2019t necessarily result in new types of cybercrimes, and instead enables the means to accelerate or scale existing crimes we are familiar with, as well as introduce new threat vectors,\u201d Dr. Peter Garraghan, CEO/CTO of AI security testing vendor Mindgard and a professor at the UK\u2019s Lancaster University, tells CSO. \u201cIf a legitimate user can find utility in using AI to automate their tasks, capture complex patterns, lower the barrier of technical entry, reduced costs, and generate new content, why wouldn\u2019t a criminal do the same?\u201d But the advent of agentic AI is beginning to change things, with AI tools no longer just assisting attackers but helping them automate operations. \u201cThe most significant shift over the past year has been AI\u2019s evolution from a simple \u2018helper\u2019 toward becoming a fully autonomous, and quite literally an attacker\u2019s partner-in-crime, capable of executing entire attack chains,\u201d says Crystal Morin, senior cybersecurity strategist at cloud-native security and visibility vendor Sysdig. Here is a look at various ways cybercriminals are putting gen AI to use in exploiting enterprise systems today. Taking phishing to the next level Gen AI enables the creation of highly convincing phishing emails, greatly increasingly the likelihood of prospective marks giving over sensitive information to scam sites or downloading malware. Instead of sending generic, unconvincing, and error-ridden emails, cybercriminals can leverage AI to quickly generate more sophisticated, personalized, and legitimate-looking emails to target specific recipients. Gen AI tools help enrich phishing campaigns by pulling together wide-ranging sources of data, including targeted information gleaned from social media. \u201cAI can be used to quickly learn what types of emails are being rejected or opened, and in turn modify its approach to increase phishing success rate,\u201d Mindgard\u2019s Garraghan explains. Facilitating malware development AI can also be used to generate more sophisticated \u2014 or less labour-intensive \u2014 malware. For example, cybercriminals are using gen AI to create malicious HTML documents. The XWorm attack, initiated by HTML smuggling, which contains malicious code that downloads and runs the malware, bears the hallmarks of development via AI. \u201cThe loader\u2019s detailed line-by-line description suggesting it was crafted using generative AI,\u201d according to HP Wolf Security\u2019s 2025 Threat Insights Report. In addition, the \u201cdesign of the HTML webpage delivering XWorm is almost visually identical as the output from ChatGPT 4o after prompting the LLM to generate an HTML page that offers a file download,\u201d HP Wolf Security added in its report. Elsewhere, ransomware group FunkSec \u2014 an Algeria-linked ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operator that takes advantage of double-extortion tactics \u2014 has begun harnessing AI technologies, according to Check Point Research. \u201cFunkSec operators appear to use AI-assisted malware development, which can enable even inexperienced actors to quickly produce and refine advanced tools,\u201d Check Point researchers wrote in a blog post. Accelerating vulnerability hunting and exploits Analyzing systems for vulnerabilities and developing exploits can also be simplified through use of gen AI. \u201cInstead of a black hat hacker spending the time to probe and perform reconnaissance against a system perimeter, an AI agent can be tasked to do this automatically,\u201d Mingard\u2019s Garraghan says. Gen AI may be behind a 62% reduction in the time between a vulnerability being discovered and its exploitation by attackers from 47 days to just 18 days, according to a study last year by threat intelligence firm ReliaQuest. \u201cThis sharp decrease strongly indicates that a major technological advancement \u2014 likely gen AI \u2014 is enabling threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speeds,\u201d ReliaQuest wrote. Adversaries are leveraging gen AI alongside pen-testing tools to write scripts for tasks such as network scanning, privilege escalation, and payload customization. AI is also likely being used by cybercriminals to analyze scan results and suggest optimal exploits, allowing them to identify flaws in victim systems faster. \u201cThese advances accelerate many phases in the kill chain, particularly initial access,\u201d ReliaQuest concluded. Cyber resilience firm Cybermindr used a different methodology to find that the average time to exploit a vulnerability had fallen to five days in 2025. \u201cAI-driven reconnaissance, automated attack scripts, and underground exploit marketplaces have accelerated the weaponization of vulnerabilities,\u201d it said. CSO\u2019s Lucian Constantin offers a deeper look at how generative AI tools are transforming the cyber threat landscape by democratizing vulnerability hunting for pen-testers and attackers alike. Launching AI-orchestrated espionage Anthropic dropped a bombshell in September 2025 when it revealed that it had disrupted a sophisticated AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign. The attackers abused Claude Code to automate approximately 80% of their campaign activities, targeting around 30 major tech firms, financial institutions, and government agencies. In a \u201csmall number of cases\u201d attacks were successful, according to the AI company, noting that an unnamed \u201cChinese state-sponsored group\u201d was likely behind the campaign, which relied on jailbreaking tools to make prohibited functions possible. Last year Carnegie Mellon\u2019s CyLab Security & Privacy Institute researchers, in collaboration with Anthropic, demonstrated that LLMs like GPT-4o can autonomously plan and execute sophisticated cyberattacks on enterprise-scale networks \u2014 without any human intervention. \u201cThe study reveals that an LLM, when structured with high-level planning capabilities and supported by specialized agent frameworks, can simulate network intrusions and closely mirror real-world breaches,\u201d a CyLab spokesperson explained. Escalating threats with alternative platforms Cybercriminals have also begun developing their own large language models (LLMs) \u2014 such as WormGPT, FraudGPT, DarkBERT, and others \u2014 built without the guardrails that constrain criminals\u2019 misuse of mainstream gen AI platforms. These platforms are commonly harnessed for applications such as phishing and malware generation. Moreover, mainstream LLMs can also be customized for targeted use. Security researcher Chris Kubecka shared with CSO in late 2024 how her custom version of ChatGPT, called Zero Day GPT, helped her identify more than 20 zero-days in a matter of months. Stealing resources via LLMjacking Threat actors are also busy stealing cloud credentials specifically to hijack costly LLM resources, either for their own gain or to sell access, in an attack technique called LLMjacking. \u201cBeyond theft of service, attackers are now actively probing newer LLM models to identify those that lack the guardrails of more mature platforms, effectively using them as unrestricted sandboxes to generate malicious code or bypass regional sanctions,\u201d Sysdig\u2019s Morin reports. Creating a Silk Road\u2013style marketplace for AI agents Beyond AI agents executing individual attacks, security experts are beginning to track examples where coordination itself is being automated or orchestrated. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing early experiments where multiple specialized agents interact, some focused on reconnaissance, others on tooling, execution, or data movement, without any single agent needing the full picture,\u201d says Lucie Cardiet, cyberthreat research manager at Vectra AI. A concrete example of this is Molt Road, which offers a dark-web-style marketplace for AI agents, albeit one with few listings at present. \u201cAutonomous agents can create listings, sell access or capabilities, coordinate tasks, and complete transactions with minimal human involvement, effectively automating the economics of cybercrime,\u201d Cardiet tells CSO. \u201cWe can expect attackers to actively leverage this model in the coming months, breaking the attack chain into specialized, cooperating agents to speed up and scale their attacks,\u201d she says. Breaking in with authentication bypass Gen AI tools can also be abused to bypass security defences such as CAPTCHAs or biometric authentication. \u201cAI can defeat CAPTCHA systems and analyse voice biometrics to compromise authentication,\u201d according to cybersecurity vendor Dispersive. \u201cThis capability underscores the need for organizations to adopt more advanced, layered security measures.\u201d Leveraging deepfakes for social engineering AI-generated deepfakes are being abused to exploit channels many employees more implicitly trust, such as voice and video, instead of relying on less convincing email-based attacks. The problem is becoming more severe with the wider availability of AI technologies capable of creating more convincing deepfakes, according to Alex Lisle, CTO of deepfake detection platform Reality Defender. \u201cThere was a recent case involving a cybersecurity company that relied on visual verification for credential resets,\u201d Lisle says. \u201cTheir process required a manager to join a Zoom call with IT to confirm an employee\u2019s identity before a password reset.\u201d Lisle explains: \u201cAttackers are now leveraging deepfakes to impersonate those managers on live video calls to authorize these resets.\u201d In the most high-profile example to date, a finance worker at design and engineering company Arup was tricked into authorizing a fraudulent HK$200 million ($25.6 million) transaction after attending a videoconference call during which fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate its UK-based CFO. Impersonating brands in malicious ad campaigns Cybercriminals have begun using gen AI tools to deliver brand impersonation campaigns delivered via ads and content platforms, rather than traditional phishing or malware. \u201cAttackers now use gen AI to mass-produce realistic ad copy, creatives, and fake support pages, then distribute them across search ads, social ads, and AI-generated content, targeting high-intent queries like \u2018brand login\u2019 or \u2018brand support,\u2019\u201d explains Shlomi Beer, co-founder and CEO at ImpersonAlly, a security startup that specializes in protecting the online advertising ecosystem. The tactic was used in ongoing a series of Google Ad account fraud, to impersonate the Cursor AI coding assistant firm, and in a fake Shopify ecommerce platform customer support scam, among other attacks. Abusing OpenClaw Attackers have also begun targeting viral personal AI agents such as OpenClaw. OpenClaw offers an open-source AI agent framework. A combination of supply chain attacks on its skill marketplace and misconfigurations open the door to potential exploits and malware slinging, as CSO covered in much more depth in our earlier report. \u201cCybercriminals can exploit these virtual assistants to steal private keys to cryptocurrency wallets and execute code on victims\u2019 devices,\u201d says Edward Wu, CEO and founder at Dropzone AI. \u201cWe can expect 2026 to be the year when security teams will try to prevent unsanctioned usage of personal AI agents.\u201d Poisoning model memories To offer short-term and longer-term context, AI agents are starting to rely more on persistent memory, opening the door for exploits that involve planting malicious memories. If an attacker injects malicious or false information into an agent\u2019s memory, that corrupted context then influences every future decision the agent makes. For example, security researcher Johann Rehberger showed how he could plant false memories in ChatGPT in September 2025. \u201cHe [Rehberger] used a malicious image with hidden instructions embedded in it to inject fabricated data into the model\u2019s long-term memory,\u201d said Siri Varma Vegiraju, security tech lead at Microsoft. \u201cThe scary part was that once the memory was poisoned, it persisted across sessions and continuously exfiltrated user data to a server the attacker controlled.\u201d Hacking AI infrastructure Over the past year, attackers have shifted from using generative AI to targeting the infrastructure that enables it. This vector of attack is exemplified in the supply chain poisoning in Model Context Protocol servers, where compromised dependencies or modified code introduced vulnerabilities into enterprise environments. For example, a counterfeit \u201cPostmark MCP Server\u201d discovered in early 2025 silently BCC\u2019d all processed emails, including internal documents, invoices, and credentials, to an attacker-controlled domain. Many other malicious MCP servers have already been identified in the wild, many designed to exfiltrate information without detection, according to Casey Bleeker CEO at SurePath AI. \u201cWe\u2019re tracking several categories of MCP-specific risk: tool poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions into AI tool descriptions that execute when the agent invokes them; supply chain compromises, where a trusted MCP server or dependency is updated post-approval to behave maliciously; and cross-tool data exfiltration, where compromised components in an agentic workflow silently siphon sensitive data through what looks like legitimate AI activity,\u201d Bleeker explains. Reality check AI technologies are powerful but they have their limitations, several experts tell CSO. Rik Ferguson, VP of security intelligence at Forescout, says cybercriminals are largely relying on AI to automate repetitive tasks rather than more complex work, such as vulnerability exploitation. \u201cThe most reliable criminal use [of AI] remains in language-heavy and workflow-heavy tasks such as phishing and pretexting, influence and outreach, triaging and contextualizing vulnerabilities, and generating boilerplate components, rather than reliably discovering and exploiting brand-new vulnerabilities end-to-end,\u201d Ferguson says. Over the past twelve months, managed detection and response firm Huntress has tracked threat actors applying AI to generate and automate traditional tradecraft, from developing scripts to browser extensions and, in some cases, even phishing lures. \u201cWe have also seen such \u2018vibe coded\u2019 scripts fail to execute and meet their objectives on multiple occasions,\u201d Anton Ovrutsky, principal tactical response analyst at Huntress, tells CSO. And while AI has certainly given threat actors a powerful tool it has, at least to date, failed to spawn any new tactics or exploit classes, according to Ovrutsky. \u201cA threat actor can indeed rapidly prototype a sophisticated credential theft script, yet the basic \u2018laws of physics\u2019 still exist; a threat actor must be in a position to execute such a script in the first place,\u201d Ovrutsky says. \u201cWe have yet to observe an exploit path that has been enabled through AI-use exclusively.\u201d Countermeasures Collectively the misuse of gen AI tools is making it easier for less skilled cybercriminals to earn a dishonest living. Defending against the attack vector challenges security professionals to harness the power of artificial intelligence more effectively than attackers. \u201cCriminal misuse of AI technologies is driving the necessity to test, detect, and respond to these threats, in which AI is also being leveraged to combat cybercriminal activity,\u201d Mindgard\u2019s Garraghan says. In a blog post, Lawrence Pingree, VP of technical marketing at Dispersive, outlines preemptive cyber defenses that security professionals can take to win what he describes as an \u201cAI ARMS (Automation, Reconnaissance, and Misinformation) race\u201d between attackers and defenders. \u201cRelying on traditional detection and response mechanisms is no longer sufficient,\u201d Pingree warns. Alongside employee education and awareness programs, enterprises should be using AI to detect and neutralize generative AI-based threats in real-time. Forescout\u2019s Ferguson says CISOs should treat enterprise AI like any other high-value SaaS platform. \u201cTighten identity and conditional access, minimize privileges, lock down keys, and monitor for anomalous AI/API usage and spend,\u201d Ferguson advises.
