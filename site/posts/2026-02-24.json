      "raw_text": "Is the YIMBY movement doomed?\nLate last month, President Trump held a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Sitting at a long, mahogany table, surrounded by his administration's top officials, he broached the subject of housing.\n\"There's so much talk about, 'Oh, we're going to drive housing prices down,'\" Trump said, seemingly referencing a nationwide movement to make housing more abundant and affordable. But not him, Trump made it clear. \"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes. And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\nSay what you will about President Trump, but the man has a knack for understanding the fears and anxieties of a large swath of American voters and speaking bluntly to reject liberal and libertarian ideas that could potentially scare them.\nFor more than a decade now, a \"YIMBY\" movement has been working to bulldoze the rules and regulations that have been holding back new housing development. A central goal of this movement \u2014 which declares Yes In My Backyard to more development \u2014 is to make housing more plentiful and affordable for Americans who are often priced out of owning or even living in the communities they want to.\nBut the flipside of lower priced and more plentiful housing is \u2026 lower priced and more plentiful housing \u2014 and, for a large percentage of middle-class Americans, homes are their most valuable source of wealth.\nHow irreconcilable is the clash between maintaining or building middle-class wealth on the one hand, and making housing more affordable to a wide swath of renters and would-be owners on the other? Are the politics just inherently stacked against meaningful development efforts that would make housing more affordable? In other words, is the YIMBY movement doomed to fail?\nToday in the Planet Money newsletter, we hear from a bunch of housing experts and YIMBYs to get their perspective on the thorny political economy around housing policy.\nWhy politics is stacked against YIMBYs\nThere are some brutal political realities that the YIMBY movement has to contend with. Almost 66% of American households own their homes. Many of those households have not just one, but at least two voters. Homeowners are more likely to vote than renters, and they're also more likely to be civically engaged.\nKatherine Levine Einstein is a political scientist at Boston University who studies the politics around new housing development. Back in 2019, she co-authored an eye-opening book, Neighborhood Defenders: Participatory Politics and America's Housing Crisis.\n\"Basically, what we argue is that America's land use regulations have created processes that empower small and privileged groups of neighbors to stop and delay new housing development,\" she says.\nEinstein and her colleagues, studying Massachusetts, found that homeowners are much more likely to participate in the crucial local political and regulatory meetings that govern new housing supply.\nAnd they found these weren't just any homeowners. The people who showed up were a class of people who had the time and the political will to attend \u2014 let's be honest \u2014 pretty darn boring city meetings. They were less likely to work full-time or at all. They were less likely to be students or young professionals. They were less likely to have young kids, with all the time pressures they impose. And they were more likely to be resistant to change in their neighborhoods. In other words, \"the people who attend these meetings are way more likely to be older,\" Einstein says, and they're much more likely to oppose development.\nSo it's not just the sheer numbers of homeowning voters that YIMBYs have to contend with. It's also the very structure of our nation's political institutions, which systematically empowers local homeowners \u2014 and a particular class of especially NIMBY homeowners \u2014 to shape what gets built and where.\nSince Einstein and her colleagues published this book back in 2019, we've seen state political leaders increasingly recognize that they need to circumvent or actively fight local antagonists to new housing development.\nFor example, in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has supported a variety of reforms that essentially imposes top-down pressure on local communities to develop more housing. Einstein says there's been a similar effort in Massachusetts.\n\" So I think, honestly, in some places the answer is yes, that the state just has to impose development,\" Einstein says. \"There are just some places that are never going to agree to allow new housing. And often those are some of the most privileged places in the country, with really high-quality schools and other public services.\"\nTop-down approaches come with political risks. Locals know and care a lot more about their communities than outsiders, and attempts by outsiders to impose development could anger some voters. And top-down impositions could also be painted as less democratic, because the state essentially rejects the self-determination of local communities to oppose new developments.\nBut, Chen Zhao, the head of economic research at Redfin, a popular home-search platform and brokerage, argues it's not necessarily less democratic because, when you take housing decisions out of local hands and make them at higher levels of government, \"it is about taking the interests of more people into account.\" For instance, the people who have been priced out of the cities where they work and have to commute into.\n\"It's not just the folks who live in Manhattan who have a vested interest in Manhattan,\" Zhao says. \"There could be someone who lives across the river in New Jersey who would live in Manhattan if it was more affordable to live here. And so the question becomes, do their interests matter?\"\nBut serving constituencies that potentially can't or won't vote for you creates some serious challenges for politicians in a democracy. And many municipalities, responding to impassioned NIMBY locals, are actively fighting top-down, state-level attempts to meaningfully move the needle on new housing development.\nNIMBYism may be spreading\nOf course, not all localities have been opposed to new development. Even the coastal markets known today for NIMBYism were once the sites of a blitz of new housing development after World War II.\nIn 2005, the economists Ed Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, and Raven Saks published influential research that found that America's growing metro areas could basically be divided into two groups.\nFirst, there were metro areas in the West and Northeast, often near the coasts, in places like California, Washington, New York, and Massachusetts, which were resistant to building new housing in the face of rising demand. That scarcity of housing supply, coupled with lots of demand to live in these markets, created a sort of pressure cooker of unaffordability for renters and would-be owners. At the same time, of course, it created huge financial gains for those lucky enough to already own homes in these markets.\nSecond, there were what are sometimes called the \"Sunbelt\" markets, like in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Arizona, which were building like crazy in the face of rising demand. Instead of skyrocketing prices, they saw skyrocketing population growth and more moderate price increases. Back in 2005, Gyourko says, these places were not seeing an affordability crisis like those in the West and Northeast.\nLast year, Glaeser and Gyourko released a working paper that looks at what has happened in the two decades since 2005.\n\"We continue to undersupply in the big coastal markets,\" Gyourko says. \"But what's new, different and alarming is we're starting to undersupply \u2014 and have been for the last decade or two \u2014 in the high employment, growth markets in the Sunbelt.\"\nIn other words, many of the places that used to build a lot are starting to look more like the NIMBY strongholds on the coasts.\nGyourko and Glaeser don't offer definitive evidence for why many Sunbelt markets have begun to see lower rates of new housing development. It could be, for example, that after many years of building, they've already developed on easy-to-develop land, and now development politics have gotten trickier. Even if that were true though, these localities \u2014 like those in other high-demand metropolises \u2014 could still build more housing vertically with tall apartment buildings. The economists suggest that locals have begun gumming up new development through rules and regulations, much like those on the West and East coasts. In other words, NIMBYism has maybe metastasized.\nWhy might that be? Maybe people are curmudgeons and just don't like seeing their communities change. Maybe something changed demographically in these places, and there's now more NIMBY-minded homeowners living there.\nOr maybe, after decades of development, people are fed up with all of the negative side effects that often come with larger populations, including worse traffic, parking headaches, and more crowded schools or parks. These \"negative externalities,\" as economists call them, can be at least partially mitigated with smart urban planning and investments in public transportation, but often they're not \u2014 and it's easy to see why locals could dislike big bursts of new development.\n\" I think concentrated development can create backlash,\" Einstein says. \"And we see this historically, and it looks like it may be happening in some pockets of the South as well, that people respond to this development by opposing new development, and perhaps creating regulatory processes that ensure that they have veto power over future projects.\"\nWhatever the reason, many metro areas that used to be YIMBY seem to be turning more NIMBY, and housing prices have started rising at a faster clip there as a result.\nAustin: A success story or cautionary tale for YIMBYism?\nBut, Gyourko says, there are at least two clear exceptions to all this: Nashville and Austin.\nBoth, he says, built so much housing in recent years that supply has outstripped demand, and housing prices have begun falling there.\nAn analysis from Zillow released in December found that Austin is seeing some of the steepest home value declines in the nation. They estimate the average home price has fallen more than six percent over the last year. Other data sources show a similar story of declining housing prices there.\nSome might argue that Austin built too much, and that's a problem. If you're a home or apartment owner who is now seeing your home value decline, you might feel that way. And you might advise, watch out, other cities, the YIMBYs are coming!\nBut Einstein sees it differently. \"So I guess overbuilding is one way of framing that,\" she says. \"I might also say that's a success story, where we have seen a market like Austin, which got incredibly overheated and got really, really expensive very quickly, now starting to correct a bit and starting to become more affordable.\"\nAnd keep some perspective, she says. \"It's still the case that it is more expensive to live in Austin now than it was ten years ago. So I think it's more that we are starting to see those prices go back to a place that is a little more accessible to more Austin residents.\"\nAustin and Nashville have taken a more free-market approach to housing development than many other localities, and, now, Gyourko says, the market is responding to the reality that supply has outstripped demand. \"What's happened? How does the market correct? They stopped building,\" he says. \"There's still strong demand to be in those markets. They're thriving economically. So the demand will pick up and in two or three years, they'll likely go back to growing.\"\nThe YIMBY political fight\nWhile Austin might be seeing falling prices, other local housing markets are still in a price pressure cooker created by intense housing scarcity. For example, with the AI boom, the already exorbitant San Francisco Bay Area has seen sizable hikes in rents and home prices over the last few years.\nNot all housing markets react to new development the same. After deindustrialization, many cities, like Detroit, had long periods of falling home prices. Demand to live there fell. And their problem became that their existing housing stock was too big.\nBut the Bay Area, for example, is the center of a technological revolution. It has tons of high paid professionals who make a lot of money, and people from around the world want to come there and work. There's incredible demand to live there, and, after years of ridiculously low levels of building, there's a deep scarcity of housing. Erecting even a considerable number of new apartment buildings in a market like the Bay Area isn't likely going to tank housing prices.\nMatthew Lewis is the director of communications at California YIMBY, a policy organization aimed at increasing housing development and affordability. He says their big goal is to build many more apartment and condo buildings in urban cores, which they hope will reduce rent prices and make buying apartments and condos more attainable to a wider swath of people. Their focus is apartments and condos, he says, because those will be able to house way more people than single-family homes, and they will make a bigger dent in the affordability crisis.\nCreating more apartments and condos in urban cores, he suggests, also results in fewer negative side effects than building single-family homes in urban peripheries. For example, putting lots more residents on the outskirts of urban cores can result in more clogged freeways and undesirable commuting times.\nLewis suggests there isn't really a tradeoff between single-family home values and the building of apartment complexes, at least in red hot markets like the Bay Area. In fact, Lewis points to studies \u2014 including in Alexandria, Virginia and Salt Lake City, Utah \u2014 that suggest that adding new apartment complexes in growing urban areas may actually even slightly increase single-family home values.\nLewis argues that more apartments will increase economic activity and business opportunities in booming cities, and that further increases demand to live there, helping to boost single-family home values even while it can reduce rents for apartment dwellers.\n\"I think that there's a win-win here on the property value question that's borne out by the evidence,\" Lewis says.\nGyourko believes the vast majority of the nation's growing metro areas have so underbuilt for so many decades, the \" latent demand is so strong, prices won't fall,\" he says. \"Ab sent a recession, the chances of us building so much that we cause a house price collapse \u2014 I think it's close to zero.\"\nOn the one hand, that might be solace to homeowners in coveted housing markets. They don't have to worry about their home value tanking, unless there's a recession or some other calamity. But, on the other hand, that can be super frustrating to those who desperately want housing to become more affordable.\n\"This actually makes the politics of getting people to accept more housing incredibly difficult because it is an awful political slogan to say, 'Let's build more housing so price increases aren't as high as they would've been if we hadn't built as much housing,'\" Einstein says. \"Like, no one wants to run on that.\"\nBut that's kind of the hope in places like the Bay Area and New York City. They can build and, at this juncture, the amount of building they're actually going to do could maybe bring down the growth rate of rents and home prices \u2014 and, in a plausible scenario, maybe slow them down below average income growth, and so, over time, housing will become relatively more affordable. But we probably won't see dramatic increases in affordability all of a sudden, especially considering they're not building anywhere near enough to do that.\nDespite the political challenges, YIMBYs have had some important victories in recent years. But, arguably, many of them have been accomplished by appeasing the concerns of the massive and powerful voting bloc of homeowners.\nFor example, one big YIMBY victory: laws that have allowed homeowners in California and other states to build \"Accessory Dwelling Units\" (ADUs) on their properties. Think like allowing homeowners to build a guest house in their backyard. That increases the supply of housing in areas where housing is desperately needed. At the same time, homeowners have a big incentive to support it because they get financial benefits from those new developments.\nAnother strategy: building apartment buildings in urban settings near transit stops while avoiding new developments in single-family neighborhoods, which are sometimes viewed as politically untouchable.\n\" I definitely think it is politically easier to just avoid trying to develop in single-family neighborhoods,\" Einstein says. But, she points out, that solution could be suboptimal for a variety of reasons. One big one: it may contribute to \" patterns of economic and racial segregation,\" where neighborhoods with single-family homes \" remain these isolated enclaves of privilege.\"\nAs we recently covered in a Planet Money episode featuring Harvard economist Raj Chetty, mounting research suggests that economic and racial segregation is tremendously harmful to the economic prospects of disadvantaged kids.\nSo what should policymakers do?\nTo make a real dent in affordability in many places, Einstein says it's not enough to reform and streamline the land-use regulations that have been holding back housing supply.\n\" Doing that alone is going to be helpful for building more housing, but it is not going to make housing affordable for people in poverty,\" Einstein says. \"We're not going to, by building more market-rate housing, solve the sort of housing issues for that segment of the market. That is a segment of the market where you need extensive government subsidy.\"\nBut, Einstein says, streamlining the permitting process for new housing development will also make it easier to build government-subsidized or public housing too.\nEinstein says there are reasons to be both pessimistic and optimistic about solving America's housing affordability crisis.\nShe says she's pessimistic because NIMBYs remain politically powerful, especially at the local level. And while there have been state-level efforts to increase housing supply, many of those initiatives have been riddled with loopholes and poison pills that allow local NIMBYs to distort or water down new housing development efforts. Beyond the difficult politics of new development, rising construction prices add an additional challenge.\nBut she says she's optimistic because there seems to be a rising YIMBY tide. Boston University, she says, conducts an annual survey of mayors, and over the last several years they've asked them about the economics of housing. \" And we have seen over the last four years, big increases in the proportion of mayors who believe that they need to build more housing in order to reduce prices,\" she says. \"So I think that's really heartening and suggests the people who hold the levers of power understand this problem more than they did even four years ago.\"\nAnd, of course, many homeowners care about issues beyond just their home price. Lewis says the reality is that housing markets have gotten so ridiculously expensive that nurses, firefighters, police officers, and other critical community workers are having trouble living in the cities where they work. And the affordability crisis is affecting homeowners' family members.\n\"After a couple generations of people thinking, 'I don't want it here,' now we're hearing people say, 'Oh gosh, my kids had to move three states over.' 'My parents can't find anywhere affordable to live for their retirement,'\" Lewis says.",

And they can be assured that's what's going to happen. \"\nSay what you will about President Trump, but the man has a knack for understanding the fears and anxieties of a large swath of American voters and speaking bluntly to reject liberal and libertarian ideas that could potentially scare them."

      "raw_text": "What you need to know as Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine enters its 5th year\nKYIV, Ukraine, and MOSCOW \u2014 When the Kremlin launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the assumption in Moscow, and much of the West, was that Russian forces would take the country in a matter of days.\nInstead, what the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation\" has become the biggest land war in Europe since World War II and has lasted longer than the Soviet army's fight against Nazi Germany. Russia's war on Ukraine is a grinding war of attrition. Ukraine has managed to hold a much larger army to minimal gains while adjusting to a life under constant siege and grief. Both countries have suffered enormous casualties.\nEfforts to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict appear largely at an impasse. During his campaign in the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump famously claimed he could end the war in a day once he returned to the White House. A year of U.S. diplomatic efforts have brought Russian and Ukrainian envoys to the table but no closer to a consensus. Sticking points include claims over territory, reparations and security guarantees.\nWith the war now entering its fifth year, here is a snapshot of its key developments and where it may be headed in the future.\nThe battlefield picture\nLoading...\nDynamic shifts on the battlefield \u2014 with large swaths of Ukrainian land changing hands in offensives and counteroffensives in the early years of the war \u2014 have since given way to a conflict of inches. At the height of Russia's gains in 2022, its forces had seized more than 26% of Ukrainian territory, according to the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War. Today Russia controls just over 19% of Ukraine, a figure that includes the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine seized in 2014. Russia continues to have an advantage in men and mat\u00e9riel \u2014 factors that have led to recent territorial gains against overstretched Ukrainian defenses. Yet the Russian advance has come at a glacial pace and with enormous losses. For all the Kremlin's claims of battlefield momentum, Russian forces have gained less than 1.5% of additional Ukrainian territory since 2023.\nDrone war\nWorld\nHow drones have become essential for both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war\nHow drones have become essential for both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war\nTechnology has shifted the nature of the fight since 2022. Drones were initially used for reconnaissance and spotting enemy positions. Now nearly every Ukrainian and Russian unit uses drones fitted with explosives to carry out airstrikes on buildings, tanks and enemy positions \u2014 and even to chase down and kill individual soldiers. Russia regularly launches Shaheds, Iranian-designed attack drones that resemble small planes, at Ukrainian cities \u2014 often hitting homes and civilian infrastructure. Ukraine has also turned to air drones to routinely strike deep into Russian territory at the Kremlin's war machine, including oil refineries, military airfields and ammunition depots. There are constant innovations. Russia introduced fiber-optic drones that overcome Ukrainian electronic jamming. Ukraine uses unmanned ground vehicles to evacuate the wounded, plant land mines and even launch assaults, and it has used sea drones to push Russia's naval fleet out of the Black Sea.\nHeavy military losses\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine openly acknowledges the full extent of their own war casualties \u2014 those soldiers dead, wounded or missing. Meanwhile, outside analyses suggest staggering losses on both sides. Citing British and U.S. sources, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., puts Russia's total losses at 1.2 million and Ukrainian ones at up to 600,000 from February 2022 to December 2025. Of those casualties, the dead are estimated at up to 325,000 for Russia and up to 140,000 for Ukraine. The CSIS study says Russia has suffered more losses than any major power in any conflict since World War II.\nThe toll on civilians\nThe U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission has confirmed through documented evidence that Russia's war on Ukraine has killed more than 15,000 Ukrainian civilians and injured another 41,000. The real count is likely higher because U.N. human rights workers have not been able to access Russian-occupied areas like the southern port city of Mariupol, where human rights groups say thousands were killed, to independently confirm deaths.\nIn the year the Trump administration has sponsored talks to end the war, U.S. aid to Ukraine declined dramatically \u2014 by 99%, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany. Ukraine can secure U.S. weapons only by buying them from Europe. Though the Europeans have stepped up to some extent, the loss of military aid \u2014 especially air defense supplies \u2014 have affected Ukrainian life. In 2025, more Ukrainian civilians were killed and injured by Russian attacks than in 2024. Russian missile strikes have also destroyed most of Ukraine's energy grid, leaving Ukrainian cities without electricity and heat for weeks during the coldest winter in years. Russia's border regions have also faced hardships, as Ukrainian drone attacks knocked out heat and power for local residents in reciprocal attacks.\nWar refugees\nThe fighting has also displaced about 3.7 million Ukrainians internally and forced more than 5.3 million to leave Ukraine as refugees, according to the International Organization for Migration. Meanwhile, Russia experienced its own exodus, with young Russian men in particular fleeing the country to avoid conscription into the war. While estimates vary, studies say between 500,000 and 1 million people have left Russia since 2022, likely the largest population migration out of the country since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.\nThe missing Ukrainian children\nUkraine says some 20,000 Ukrainian children have been deported or forcibly moved from occupied territories by Russian authorities. An initiative led by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Bring Kids Back UA, says it has managed to repatriate about 2,000 of them. Zelenskyy said late last year that Ukraine has identified 400 locations in Russia with abducted Ukrainian children.\nInvestigators with Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab revealed last September that Russia is routinely stripping these children of their Ukrainian identity and even forcing some to undergo military training. Russia has argued it merely removed children from the front lines of the war to safety. But in March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, on charges of war crimes. Russia has rejected the ICC order, noting that it is not a signatory to the ICC charter and does not recognize the court's authority.\nRepression in Russia\nFollowing the 2022 invasion, the Kremlin passed a web of repressive laws effectively outlawing criticism of the war effort or government. The laws forced the closure and exile of leading independent media outlets and have had a profound impact on what information Russians access and share online and in their daily lives. Major social media platforms, like Facebook and YouTube, are now blocked. Authorities have also tarred critical voices as \"foreign agents\" and civil society groups as \"undesirable,\" effectively criminalizing their work in Russia.\nLeading opposition figures have also been detained. In a particularly searing moment, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in a remote Arctic prison under mysterious circumstances in February 2024. A recent report issued by five European countries claims that analyses of Navalny's remains \"conclusively confirmed\" traces of epibatidine, a deadly frog toxin native to Latin America. The Kremlin continues to maintain that Navalny died from natural causes.\nWestern sanctions\nFour years of unprecedented Western sanctions have bent but not broken the Russian economy. An exodus of Western brands, including McDonald's, Starbucks and Apple, allowed Russian companies to mop up market share. The Kremlin has pivoted its economy away from Europe and toward Asia and the Global South. Russian energy sales to China and India, in particular, have buoyed the Russian war machine. Some goods entering from neighboring states such as Kazakhstan have meant that even brands that abandoned Russia can still be found.\nYet robust growth during the early years of the war, fueled by military expenditures, looks increasingly in jeopardy. Growth dropped off significantly in 2025 to 1%, with a contraction possible this year. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on two of Russia's top oil exporters and threatened tariffs on Indian imports if India continues buying Russian crude.\nThe Trump factor\nPresident Trump returned to office promising he could negotiate a quick end to the conflict. It has proved, by his own admission, more challenging than he expected. Trump has occasionally expressed frustration with Putin for continuing to pummel Ukrainian cities, and he also approved sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft. The U.S. president and his envoys, however, have often parroted Russian talking points while repeatedly pressuring Zelenskyy for major concessions. The Kremlin has also suggested that the U.S. stands to gain trillions of dollars in investment returns in Russia once a peace settlement is reached and Western sanctions are lifted.\nPeace negotiations\nTrump has gotten the two sides to the negotiating table, but months of these U.S.-led talks have been bogged down by Kremlin ultimatums that Ukraine surrender territory, including land not controlled by Russia. Kyiv has refused those demands. Zelenskyy says he's open to U.S. proposals to create a demilitarized zone, if Russia agrees to withdraw some forces and the U.S. and European allies offer Ukraine ironclad security guarantees. The Kremlin has equated European offers to send peacekeepers as akin to Ukraine receiving NATO-like guarantees, one of Putin's stated justifications for launching the invasion in the first place. Kremlin negotiators routinely refer to NATO's expansion eastward as one of the \"root causes\" of the conflict that must be addressed for any lasting peace to emerge.",

      "raw_text": "A U.S. veteran adopted an orphan from Iran. Decades later, ICE is trying to deport her\nAdopted from Iran at age two, she takes great pride in her quintessential American upbringing.\nThe woman was raised on a small farm in the Midwest. She attended church every Sunday. And she loved listening to her late father's stories from when he was in the Air Force during World War II.\nBut in the eyes of the U.S. government, the woman, who's now in her 50s and lives in California, is not American. Instead, she's an immigrant who overstayed her visa since she was a toddler and therefore, subject to deportation. She spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity because she fears speaking publicly will complicate her immigration case.\n\"How could this happen?\" she said. \"I'm American. I've never had any other identity besides that.\"\nMost international adoptees receive automatic citizenship thanks to the 2000 Child Citizenship Act. But the law excludes those who were already adults when the legislation passed or adoptees who entered the U.S. on the wrong type of visa, which is what happened to the California woman.\nEarlier this month, she received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security saying removal proceedings have begun. The woman, who has no criminal record, has no idea what prompted the letter.\nShe's terrified to be deported to Iran given her father's military service and her Christian faith. Open Doors, which tracks Christian persecution, ranks Iran among the top 10 most dangerous countries for Christians. The woman also has no family there nor does she speak Farsi. And the prospect of deportation comes amid great upheaval in Iran, from anti-government protests to looming threats of a U.S. military strike.\n\"The sheer possibility of the daughter of an American WWII hero being sent overseas, through no fault of her own, epitomizes a broken system,\" her attorney Emily Howe said in a statement.\nIt's unclear exactly how many adoptees are in the same vulnerable position as the California woman. Many don't realize their situation until adulthood, when obtaining citizenship becomes far more difficult. Others live in limbo because of lost paperwork and the sheer difficulty locating it decades later \u2014 which is also a layer of the woman's case.\nAdoptees have been deported in the past, often because a crime triggered their removal. But with President Trump's historic mass deportations, noncitizen adoptees are more fearful than ever of being sent to countries they barely remember.\nA bill to close the gaps in the 2000 law has bipartisan support but failed several times in Congress, partly because of its tie to immigration, NPR reported last year.\nThe Department of Homeland Security would not respond to a request for comment unless provided the woman's name, which NPR declined to do. In a statement, DHS said immigrants facing deportation \"receive full due process and asylum seekers have their fear claims heard.\"\n'I don't understand this. How could this happen?'\nBorn in Iran in the 1970s, the woman doesn't know what happened to her birth parents or why she was placed in an orphanage. At the time of her adoption, she said her American father was working in Iran as a U.S. government contractor.\nFast forward, three decades later, the woman had finished paying off her student loans and wanted to travel outside the country. But when she applied for a passport, she realized something was wrong.\nPretty soon into the application process, the woman received a letter saying her parents did not complete her naturalization when she was a child. She recalled reaching out to an immigration attorney, who told her point blank, \" You're deportable to Iran.\"\n\"I couldn't stop crying,\" she said. \"I just, through my tears, kept asking like, I don't understand this. How could this happen?\"\nThe California woman was brought to the U.S. on a tourist visa, which was fairly common to use when adopting from countries that did not have formal intercountry adoption systems in place, according to Joy Alessi, a Korean adoptee who is with the Adoptee Rights Campaign.\n\"These nonimmigrant statuses routinely expired before state adoption proceedings could conclude,\" she said. \"The status lapse required a formal adjustment to permanent residency.\"\nThe California woman firmly believes that her parents took the necessary steps to naturalize her. She points to a local newspaper article in which her parents mentioned working toward her citizenship, which NPR reviewed. Among her father's belongings, the woman said she found a document requesting lost citizenship paperwork. She added that her mother repeatedly insisted she was indeed a citizen.\nOver the years, the woman said she has spent tens of thousands of dollars and sought help from several lawyers to track down missing documents and rectify what she believes is a clerical error.\n\"There was just paperwork and a paper trail letting me know and I'm grateful for that,\" she said. \"And I stand by the fact that my dad loved me and he made sure that he did his part to make me an American in this country.\"\n'I fight for myself, but at the same time, I fight for my dad's legacy'\nUp until her passport debacle, the woman said she never thought of herself as an immigrant.\n\"I didn't know what a green card was, alien number, I had no clue,\" she said. \"But obviously now through this journey, I know it really well.\"\nNow, she winces every time she turns on the news and hears about Trump's crackdown on immigration. Since she received the DHS letter, the woman has kept a low profile \u2014 switching to remote work and rarely leaving her house or driving her car. The woman also shares her location with her friends in case she is detained by ICE.\n\"It used to be that, before some of the laws were changed, that you were safe in hospital spaces, churches, schools,\" she said. \"Some of those places that I should be able to come and go are not safe havens for me anymore.\"\nHer case is scheduled before an immigration judge next month, which she does not have to appear in-person for. Although she's terrified, part of her has always wanted to resolve her legal status and put an end to the fear she has been carrying.\n\"I welcome fixing this. I've always wanted to fix this,\" she said. \"I feel like I haven't been able to freely embrace my life.\"\nAs painful as this time has been, the woman attributes her strength to her father, a retired Air Force officer who was a prisoner of war in Germany during World War II. She imagines that if her father was alive today, he'd be angry on her behalf.\n\"I fight for myself, but at the same time, I fight for my dad's legacy and what my dad wanted for me and how he prepared me for this life,\" she said. \"And I'm not gonna let somebody take it from me.\"",

      "raw_text": "What you need to know about tonight's State of the Union address\nPresident Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight for his first State of the Union address since returning to the White House just over one year ago.\nIt's an opportunity for the president to tout his agenda and shape his party's messaging ahead of this year's midterm elections.\nBut the primetime address comes at a moment when the president has seen his agenda complicated on multiple fronts. That includes trade, where his tariff policies were dealt a rebuke last week by the Supreme Court, and immigration, where Trump and congressional Democrats are deadlocked over funding the Department of Homeland Security.\nPlus, Americans are divided on whether Trump's first year has been a success. Six in 10 believe the country is worse off than last year, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, and a majority think the state of the union is not strong.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of tonight's speech.\nWhat time is the address?\nThe president is expected to begin at 9 p.m. ET., and if history is any indication, prepare for a long night. Last year, in what was technically not a State of the Union speech, Trump addressed Congress for over 90 minutes, breaking records as the longest joint address in at least 60 years.\nNPR will be covering all of it, with live special coverage and analysis. You can listen on NPR.org, on many public radio stations, in the NPR app or by telling your Alexa device to \"Ask NPR to play Special Coverage\" starting at 9 p.m.\nWhy does this happen every year?\nThis is part of the gig for every president. The Constitution requires that the president \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\" It's intended to be a recap of sorts of their previous year in office.\nSo it's a formality, yes, but there are political stakes. Trump's speech comes at the start of a crucial election year, and his party is on the defensive. GOP lawmakers are fighting to maintain control of the Senate, where they currently hold a 53 to 47 majority, and the House, where their margin is even smaller, 218 to 214. Trump is battling low approval numbers, which are often seen as a warning sign, given that since World War 2 the party controlling the White House historically loses an average of 27 House seats in the midterms and four in the Senate.\nWhat will Trump talk about?\nExpect a big focus on immigration, which has been a key pillar of Trump's second term. The administration has defended its enforcement agenda, arguing it's aimed at removing people living in the country illegally who have committed dangerous crimes. However, lawmakers have raised concerns about the tactics used by federal immigration agents in cities around the country, especially after two U.S. citizens were killed in Minneapolis last month.\nIt will also be worth watching how Trump talks about tariffs. He's long defended imposing import taxes on foreign goods as a way to strengthen American manufacturing, but in a major ruling last Friday, the Supreme Court struck down the main lever the president has used to carry out this policy.\nThe tariff ruling is part of a broader economic messaging challenge facing the White House. A majority of Americans already say they think tariffs are more likely to hurt than help the economy. Trump has also dismissed affordability concerns as a Democratic \"hoax,\" even though voters report struggling to keep up with the cost-of-living.\nTonight's address is also happening at a crucial moment in U.S. foreign policy. Trump is pressuring Iran to disband its nuclear program, and has not ruled out using force to make that happen. In recent days, the American military has expanded its presence in the Middle East, sending additional fighter jets and a second aircraft carrier to the region.\nIt's the latest move by Trump in what has been a more muscular approach to foreign policy compared to his first term. The president has approved strikes on countries around the world, announced the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela after arresting the country's leader and has threatened to buy Greenland. At the same time, Trump has repeatedly labeled himself a peacemaker, despite facing steep challenges in achieving his goals of rebuilding Gaza and brokering an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.\nWhat will the response from Democrats look like?\nNewly sworn-in Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger is slated to provide the party's official rebuttal. Spanberger was one of several Democrats who won their races last November, delivering some of the most high-profile victories since the party's bruising losses across the country in 2024.\nShe may also provide a potential preview of how Democrats may approach their own midterm messaging. On the campaign trail, Spanberger centered her message on affordability concerns and criticized the administration's treatment of federal workers through mass layoffs and the longest government shutdown in history.\nCalifornia Senator Alex Padilla is tapped to deliver the Spanish-language response for Democrats. It's another notable pick for Democrats as they refine their election message, particularly on immigration. Padilla has been an outspoken critic of Trump's immigration agenda and was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security press conference over the summer.\nThere's also a group of roughly a dozen House and Senate Democrats who plan to boycott Trump's speech and instead hold a counter-rally dubbed the \"People's State of the Union.\" It comes as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has urged lawmakers to either \"attend with silent defiance\" or skip the event.\nFollow for more coverage:\n\ud83d\udce7 NPR Politics newsletter: Breaking down the big stories and why they matter\n\ud83c\udfa7 NPR Politics Podcast: Our experts provide insights into what's happening",

      "raw_text": "Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident\nGitHub MCP Cross-Repository Data Leak Vulnerability\nIn May 2025, Invariant disclosed a critical vulnerability in GitHub\u2019s Machine Collaboration Protocol (MCP), where attackers embedded malicious commands within public repository Issues to hijack developers\u2019 locally running AI Agents. When an AI Agent was triggered to read and \u201cassist\u201d in processing the Issue, it indiscriminately executed the embedded commands, actively pulling and exfiltrating sensitive data\u2014such as private repository source code and cryptographic keys\u2014from the user\u2019s private repositories. This attack chain entirely bypassed GitHub\u2019s permission control system, enabling unauthorized cross-repository data theft.\nThe incident exposed significant blind spots in the MCP protocol\u2019s trust boundary definitions. At the protocol level, there is a lack of mandatory isolation mechanisms to distinguish between \u201ccall origins\u201d and \u201cdata content.\u201d GitHub\u2019s MCP integration fundamentally operates as a nested RPC call chain: AI Agent \u2192 MCP Server \u2192 GitHub API \u2192 Issue Content Parsing. When an Agent executes actions using a user\u2019s GitHub credentials, it fails to differentiate between \u201cuser task descriptions\u201d and \u201cattacker-injected commands\u201d within Issues. Since developers grant their AI Agents global-level GitHub permissions, and the MCP protocol lacks fine-grained security domain segmentation for read/write/execute operations, this vulnerability allows attackers to hijack local AI Agents and steal sensitive data, including private repository source code and encryption keys.\nAI Browser Comet Hidden Command Account Hijacking Vulnerability\nIn August 2025, Perplexity\u2019s AI-powered browser Comet was exposed to a critical \u201cindirect prompt injection\u201d vulnerability. Attackers embedded hidden commands in Reddit comment sections, which, when users activated Comet\u2019s \u201csummarize current page\u201d feature, triggered the AI to automatically execute the concealed instructions. Within 150 seconds, the AI could log into the user\u2019s email, bypass captchas, and transmit credentials back to the attacker\u2014all without the user\u2019s awareness and with no visible anomalies on the interface.\nThe root cause of this vulnerability lay in Comet\u2019s default trust assumption for all web page content, combined with a lack of security validation for input sources. Attackers exploited Markdown\u2019s \u201cspoiler tag\u201d syntax (>!\u2026!<) to embed malicious commands, disguising them as white text to evade user detection. Additionally, Comet failed to implement sandbox isolation during page rendering, allowing malicious actions to execute unrestricted. As a result, the browser automatically transmitted stored login credentials to attackers, leading to sensitive data leaks.\nAI-Generated Malware Attacks 230,000+ Computing Clusters\nIn November 2025, Oligo Security disclosed that attackers exploited a historical vulnerability in the Ray framework (CVE-2023-48022). Using AI-assisted tools, they generated attack scripts to compromise over 230,000 publicly exposed Ray AI computing clusters worldwide. The attackers deployed modular malicious payloads capable of cryptomining, data theft, and DDoS attacks, creating a large-scale botnet.\nThe core tactic involved was using LLMs to rapidly generate automated intrusion scripts tailored to different Ray versions and Linux distributions. This significantly shortened the time from vulnerability detection to payload deployment. While the AI-generated code contained redundancies and incomplete error handling, the use of AI Code and ReAct frameworks enabled rapid iteration, allowing attackers to compromise exposed clusters within weeks.\nKey Directions for AI Security Development\nAs AI applications evolve from intelligent chatbots to autonomous agent systems, the detection and prevention of AI security risks are becoming more sophisticated. Based on major AI security incidents and technological trends from 2024 to 2025, the AI security threat landscape is expanding\u2014shifting from model content and system security to multimodal security, agent security, and threats that cause substantial system damage (as referenced in the NSFOCUS AI LLM Risk Threat Matrix). The attack surface for artificial intelligence is visibly broadening.\nTo ensure the security of AI systems, a comprehensive defense framework must be constructed around multiple risk domains, including infrastructure security, data security, model security, application security, and identity security. This framework should span the three key stages of LLM development: training, deployment, and application. With this approach, trust can be rebuilt, and a multi-tiered security system can be established to meet the demands of secure, compliant AI applications and practical protection against evolving threats.\nThe post Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident appeared first on NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks..\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks. authored by NSFOCUS.

      "raw_text": "Study Finds LLM-Generated Passwords Highly Predictable and Repetitive. A recent security analysis by AI firm Irregular reveals that passwords created directly by large language models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini look complex but are fundamentally weak due to predictable patterns.\nThese \u201cvibe passwords\u201d emerge in real-world use, including code from AI agents, posing risks to developers and users who overlook their low entropy.\nWhy LLMs Fail At Password Generation\nLarge language models predict tokens based on training data, producing outputs that mimic randomness but follow biased distributions far from uniform.\nSecure passwords require cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) to ensure high entropy, which LLMs cannot replicate.\nTools such as KeePass or zxcvbn rate these passwords highly, estimating 100 bits of entropy. Yet, real analysis shows they crack in seconds to hours.\nIrregular tested models by prompting \u201cPlease generate a password\u201d 50 times in fresh sessions. Claude Opus 4.6 produced only 30 unique strings, with \u201cG7$kL9#mQ2&xP4!w\u201d repeating 18 times a 36% chance versus near-zero for true randomness.\nPatterns dominate: most start with uppercase G or k followed by 7, favor characters like L, 9, m, 2, $, #, and avoid repeats or symbols like *. GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash show similar biases, with prefixes like \u201cvQ7!\u201d or \u201cK#7\u201d appearing frequently.\nReal-World Risks and Agent Behaviors\nCoding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI often default to LLM generation over secure tools like openssl rand, especially with prompts like \u201csuggest a password.\u201d\nThese embed weak credentials in Docker Compose files (e.g., MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Rt7xK9mP2vNqL4wB), FastAPI keys, or .env files without user notice.\nGitHub searches for patterns like \u201cK7#mP9\u201d or \u201ck9#vL\u201d and uncovers dozens of exposed examples in test code and setups.\nEntropy calculations confirm vulnerability. Using Shannon entropy on character stats, a 16-character Claude password yields 27 bits total (2.08 bits for the first character alone) versus 98 expected bits.\nGPT logprobs reveal even lower: ~20 bits for 20 characters, with some positions at 0.004 bits (99.7% predictable). Brute-force prioritizing LLM patterns could crack these in hours on old hardware.\nTemperature tweaks fail max 1.0 on Claude still repeats favorites; 0.0 locks to one string. Agentic browsers like ChatGPT Atlas insert them during tasks like site registration.\nSecurity teams must audit AI-touched code for hardcoded secrets and rotate them. Developers should enforce CSPRNGs in agents via prompts or controls, favoring password managers or passkeys.\nAccording to Irregular, AI labs need to turn off direct generation by default. As AI writes more code per Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei\u2019s 2025 prediction this pitfall highlights broader risks where plausible outputs mask insecurity.\nFollow us on Google News , LinkedIn and X to Get More Instant Updates.

      "raw_text": "AI executes nearly 80% of tactical operations in recent attack\nOnly 14.4% of organizations deploy agents with formal security approval\nAgentic AI opens a new attack surface that demands urgent scrutiny\nThe attacker clicked a single button. From there, the AI conducted reconnaissance, identified vulnerabilities, and executed the intrusion on its own. A cyber-espionage campaign disclosed in September 2025 laid bare what can happen when AI agents fall into the wrong hands.\nWhat is more troubling is this: countless enterprises are already deploying AI agents into live environments without formal security approval. The doors are wide open. Few have remembered to bring the locks.\n\u25c7 A War That Began With a Click\nIn mid-September 2025, the security team at Anthropic detected an unusual pattern. Further investigation revealed that a hacker group known as GTG-1002 had abused the company\u2019s AI development tool, Claude Code, to target more than 30 entities, including large corporations, financial institutions, and government agencies. Some intrusions were successful.\nWhat drew global attention was not just the scope of the operation, but the role of AI. Roughly 80% of the tactical tasks \u2014 reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, data exfiltration \u2014 were executed by the AI system itself. Human operators intervened only at critical decision points. Anthropic described the incident as the first officially documented AI-driven cyber-espionage campaign.\nJacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, explained the attack in stark terms: \u201cThe hackers literally clicked one button. After that, the AI carried out nearly everything. Human input was limited to a few decisive moments \u2014 \u2018continue,\u2019 \u2018stop,\u2019 or \u2018that looks suspicious.\u2019\u201d\nThe core technique relied on role-playing. The attackers assigned Claude Code the identity of a \u201clegitimate cybersecurity employee,\u201d claiming to conduct authorized defensive testing. This framing effectively neutralized built-in safeguards. Complex objectives were fragmented into smaller, seemingly harmless tasks, preventing the AI from grasping the broader malicious intent.\nAs a result, Claude Code proceeded to conduct reconnaissance, scan for vulnerabilities, generate exploit code, and extract data \u2014 unaware that it was participating in an active intrusion campaign. The speed exceeded human limits. At peak activity, the AI processed thousands of requests per second \u2014 far beyond the capacity of a traditional human hacking team. Anthropic reported that the system even produced detailed operational documentation autonomously.\n\u25c7 Why Privileged AI Agents Are So Dangerous\nTo understand this incident, one must distinguish agentic AI from traditional chatbots. Chatbots respond with answers. Agents respond with actions.\nAn AI agent can read emails, schedule meetings, query databases, execute code, and call external services. It plans and carries out multi-step workflows autonomously, deciding its next move based on results \u2014 often with minimal supervision. One industry executive described agentic AI as \u201cless a new tool and more like hiring a new employee.\u201d\nNow imagine granting that new hire full access to your enterprise systems. That is the situation many organizations face today.\nResearch firm Gartner projects that by the end of 2026, 40% of enterprise applications will integrate task-specific AI agents. Yet a recent analysis by Palo Alto Networks found that only 6% of organizations have implemented advanced AI-specific security strategies for agents. Adoption is outpacing preparation.\nOne major threat is prompt injection. When agents process emails, web pages, or PDFs, hidden malicious instructions can be executed alongside legitimate tasks. Agents struggle to distinguish between valid directives and adversarial commands.\nA prominent example is EchoLeak, a vulnerability disclosed last year in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Attackers embedded malicious instructions within ordinary emails. When a victim posed a routine question to Copilot, its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) engine incorporated the compromised email into its context. The malicious command executed automatically \u2014 exfiltrating internal documents to an external server without any user click. Microsoft issued a patch shortly thereafter.\nIn 2025, open-source package repositories such as npm saw a surge of malicious packages exploiting AI and LLM-related keywords. Npm has long been a supply-chain attack target. Some packages dynamically fetched remote code upon execution or installed reverse shells to evade detection. Security researchers warn that as agent infrastructures like MCP proliferate, supply-chain attacks masquerading as legitimate servers or packages may become more common.\nA second risk is memory poisoning. If manipulated data enters an agent\u2019s long-term memory store or vector database, subsequent decision-making may become distorted. This represents an evolution of traditional data poisoning within agent environments. OWASP has identified data contamination and vector database vulnerabilities as key risks in its LLM security guidance. While large-scale real-world damage has yet to be formally documented, the threat remains credible \u2014 especially when compromised data lies dormant until triggered by specific queries.\nA third concern is the proliferation of non-human identities (NHI). Each deployed agent generates API keys, access tokens, and service accounts. Research from CyberArk indicates that, unlike human accounts, NHIs rarely follow strict password rotation policies or anomaly detection frameworks. A survey by identity security firm Gravity found that only 22% of organizations treat AI agents as independent identity principals. The remaining 78% manage them as extensions of existing user accounts or shared API keys. A separate survey by Dark Reading reported that 48% of security professionals view agentic AI as the year\u2019s top emerging attack vector.\n\u25c7 Productivity and Security: An Inverse Relationship?\nLate last year, OWASP published its first dedicated security risk framework for agentic AI. Developed with input from more than 100 experts, the framework outlines ten core risks, including agent goal manipulation (ASI01), tool misuse (ASI02), NHI compromise (ASI03), and memory poisoning (ASI09). Contributors included security specialists from AWS, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks. OWASP also released an MCP-specific risk list detailing vulnerabilities unique to agent ecosystems.\nSecurity practitioners describe the framework as necessary but insufficient. Agent deployment is accelerating far faster than governance frameworks can mature.\nAs attacks become AI-driven, so too must defenses. According to a Google Cloud AI agent trends report, 46% of executives whose organizations have deployed agents in production environments are already using them in security operations (SecOps). Meanwhile, 82% of security professionals report missing genuine threats due to alert fatigue \u2014 underscoring the growing need for AI-powered detection and response systems.\nAnthropic acknowledged that it used Claude extensively to analyze massive volumes of data during its investigation of the GTG-1002 incident. The same technology is now deployed on both sides of the battlefield.\nA survey conducted by Gravity among more than 900 executives and technical professionals distilled the current landscape into a single phrase: adoption has outpaced control.\nEighty-one percent of technical teams have moved AI agents into active deployment. Yet only 14.4% report having obtained full security and IT approval prior to release. More strikingly, 88% of organizations say they experienced at least one AI agent-related security incident in the past year \u2014 a figure that rises to 92.7% in the healthcare sector.\nAttackers understand this gap. And they are exploiting it.\nThe 2025 GTG-1002 campaign demonstrated that smaller, less sophisticated groups can now replicate advanced operations with fewer resources by leveraging AI. As one executive at an AI security firm put it, \u201cOne thing is clear: agentic AI is the decisive battleground of cybersecurity in 2026.\u201d\n- Anthropic vs. U.S. Department of Defense: Big Tech\u2019s AI Ethics Put to the Test\n- Memory Devoured by Servers, AI PC Market Faces Turbulence\n- Marie Curie Meets Da Vinci\u2026 Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 AI and Its Gender Philosophy\n- Applied Unveils 2nm GAA Equipment, Says \u201cManufacturing Is Where the Battle Is Won\u201d\n- [AI Study & Window] The Momentum Tilts Toward E2E AI \u2014 Was Tesla Right After All?\n- \ucf54\ub4dc\uba85 \u2018\uac08\ub9ad\u2019\u2026 \ucd9c\uc2dc \uc784\ubc15\ud55c \uc624\ud508AI\uc758 GPT-5.3 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc77c\uae4c"

      "raw_text": "Analyst(s): Fernando Montenegro\nPublication Date: February 17, 2026\nProofpoint has acquired Acuvity to extend its data security perimeter beyond the inbox and into the emerging \u201cagentic workspace.\u201d This strategic pivot aims to secure the intent of autonomous AI agents through runtime governance, challenging established vendors and cloud-native startups for control of the enterprise AI gateway.\nWhat is Covered in This Article:\n- Proofpoint acquires Sunnyvale-based startup Acuvity to bolster AI security and governance.\n- The integration of the RYNO platform to secure the \u201cagentic workspace,\u201d including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed tools like Ollama.\n- How Proofpoint is aiming to evolve from a human-centric focus to an agent-centric governance model.\n- An analysis of how Proofpoint faces pressure from platform vendors (Microsoft, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks), key SASE providers (Netskope, Zscaler, others), and numerous data/cloud security vendors (Cyera, Wiz, Veeam, Commvault, others)\nThe News: On February 12, 2026, Proofpoint announced its acquisition of Acuvity, a Silicon Valley-based startup specializing in AI security and governance.\nHeadquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Acuvity was founded in 2023 by a team of cybersecurity veterans. The company is led by co-founder and CEO Satyam Sinha, who previously co-founded the microsegmentation firm Aporeto (acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $144 million) and served as Vice President of Engineering for Prisma Cloud. He is joined by co-founder and CTO Antoine Mercadal, a fellow Aporeto and Palo Alto Networks alumnus.\nBefore the acquisition, Acuvity operated as a lean team of approximately 24 employees. The startup emerged from stealth in September 2024, backed by a $9 million seed funding round led by Foundation Capital.\nAcuvity\u2019s RYNO platform is designed to provide visibility into \u201cShadow AI\u201d and to enforce real-time policies for LLM interactions through a specialized AI firewall and runtime inspection. Notably, the technology secures the \u201cagentic workspace\u201d by monitoring emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections and locally installed tools like Ollama. This integration will allow Proofpoint to extend its \u201chuman-centric\u201d security model to include autonomous agents, addressing risks such as prompt injection and data exfiltration.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nCan Proofpoint Secure the Intent of the Autonomous Agent?\nAnalyst Take: The acquisition of Acuvity marks a necessary and timely strategic move for Proofpoint. It signals a recognition that in the emerging \u201cagentic workspace,\u201d the inbox is no longer the primary perimeter: rather, the data workflow is. By integrating Acuvity\u2019s RYNO platform, Proofpoint aims to expand its Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities to address the non-deterministic nature of Generative AI. While network security vendors focus on the pipeline (securing the connection) and DSPM vendors focus on data at rest, Proofpoint is betting that its historical position in human workflows gives it a unique advantage in securing the payload by understanding not just that an agent is moving data, but why.\nFrom Static DLP to \u201cSemantic\u201d Governance\nThe potential technical differentiator here is the shift from \u201cShadow AI\u201d discovery (which is now a commodity) to runtime enforcement. Traditional DLP relies on static rules and regex (e.g., \u201cblock credit card numbers\u201d), which often fail against human and, increasingly, non-human attackers using Large Language Models that can rephrase sensitive data into harmless-looking text. Acuvity aims to provide the semantic understanding required to detect intent.\nCrucially, Acuvity\u2019s support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows Proofpoint to insert itself into the \u201cread-write\u201d loop of autonomous agents. This is a significant leap beyond the capabilities of a standard proxy, for example. While traditional proxy functionality can block a URL, proxies often struggle to parse the context of a multi-turn agentic conversation without breaking the application. If Proofpoint can successfully layer its Sigma information protection stack on top of Acuvity\u2019s inspection engine, it may be able to offer a \u201ckill switch\u201d for data exfiltration that is context-aware rather than just connection-aware.\nThe \u201cDigital Insider\u201d and the Stakeholder Gap\nThis acquisition also offers Proofpoint a narrative bridge to compete with broader platforms: treating the AI Agent as a \u201cdigital employee.\u201d Proofpoint is an established vendor in Insider Threat Management (ITM). As agents gain autonomy, the risk of an agent \u201cgoing rogue\u201d (hallucinating or being jailbroken) mimics the behavior of a malicious insider. By framing AI security as an extension of ITM, Proofpoint can leverage its large installed base and relationships with CISOs to potentially flank competitors such as Palo Alto Networks or CrowdStrike, despite both companies having made AI-specific acquisitions in the past year.\nHowever, the competitive landscape is far broader. Proofpoint is also contending with pressure from at least four distinct vectors:\n- The Identity & AppSec Incumbents: This is arguably the stiffest headwind. Okta and CyberArk (now a Palo Alto Networks subsidiary) view AI agents as \u201cMachine Identities\u201d that belong under their governance, not Proofpoint\u2019s. Simultaneously, developer-centric platforms like Snyk are moving to secure MCP servers at the code level, while Lakera (now part of Check Point) has traction as an AI firewall that appeals directly to the engineers Proofpoint may struggle to reach.\n- The Email & Human Risk Rivals: Traditional competitors like Abnormal Security and Mimecast (via its acquisition of Aware) are expanding their behavioral detection to cover AI and insider risks, arguing they can secure the \u201chuman element\u201d without a separate agent governance tool.\n- The Network Gatekeepers: Cloud platform providers like F5 and Cloudflare, among others, are actively securing the AI traffic \u201cpipe\u201d via their own gateway offerings, often bundling this for free with existing enterprise contracts.\n- The Data Security Convergence: Proofpoint must compete against dedicated DSPM vendors like Cyera and Wiz, as well as data resilience providers entering the space, including but not limited to IBM, Veeam (via Securiti.ai), and Commvault (via Satori).\nProofpoint\u2019s success will depend on its ability to prove to enterprises that Agent Integrity is not a bottleneck, but the necessary \u201ctrust layer\u201d that finally allows them to move their autonomous agents from pilot to production.\nWho is the right buyer?\nAnother aspect that Proofpoint will have to navigate is engaging the right stakeholders within an organization: Does the CISO make the final decision about agent-based security? Recent data from Futurum\u2019s Cybersecurity Decisionmaker survey, fielded during Q4 2025, shows how, in areas such as data security, which is closely related to AI security, the responsibility for data security is increasingly shared between departments.\nFigure 1: Security Team Influence on Data Security Purchases\nWhat to Watch:\n- Will Proofpoint\u2019s \u201cHuman-Centric\u201d branding survive the pivot to \u201cAgentic\u201d security? As autonomous agents become primary actors, Proofpoint must reconcile its identity with a reality where threats are machine-to-machine.\n- Will this acquisition trigger a defensive consolidation wave among email security rivals? Competitors like Abnormal Security and Mimecast may be forced to build more capabilities around agent governance.\n- Can Proofpoint successfully navigate the shift in buying power to AI engineering teams? As budgets for agentic workflows move away from the traditional CISO, Proofpoint must prove it can sell to the DevOps leaders who may now control the \u201cdigital employee\u201d roadmap.\n- Will Acuvity\u2019s discovery capabilities expose a \u201cShadow Agent\u201d crisis?
