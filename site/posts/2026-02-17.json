      "raw_text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s relationship with U.S. Coast Guard officials has become strained throughout her first year leading the department, according to two U.S. officials, a Coast Guard official and a former Coast Guard official.\nThe tensions between Noem and the only branch of the U.S. military overseen by DHS stem from some early decisions she made that rankled Coast Guard officials, including a verbal directive to shift Coast Guard resources from a search-and-rescue mission to find a missing service member, the sources said.\nNoem\u2019s leadership at DHS has created a specific split in the Coast Guard. Many rank-and-file members are motivated by her approach, where she showcases their work by joining them on operations and visiting their ships. Some more senior officials, however, see that approach as taking away from the Coast Guard\u2019s traditional missions.\nThe dynamic with more senior officials has only worsened in recent months as Noem oversaw a tenfold increase in the use of Coast Guard aircraft for migrant deportations, which has strained their limited resources, the sources said. The increase was captured in data compiled by ICE Flight Monitor, a non-profit group that tracks deportation flights.\n\u201cIt puts so much stress on the Wing,\u201d the Coast Guard official said, referring to the branch\u2019s aviation units.\nNoem\u2019s focus on meeting the Trump administration\u2019s deportation quotas appears poised to further impact Coast Guard operations in the coming months, according to new guidance recently issued to Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento this year. Based on DHS priorities, the air station, which is among those responsible for a majority of deportation flights, has designated its first priority to be the transport of detained immigrants on its C-27 aircraft within the U.S., according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the orders.\nThe new orders moved search-and-rescue operations, which have long been the Coast Guard\u2019s core mission, to a lower priority, the officials familiar with the orders said. They said counternarcotics efforts and Coast Guard training are prioritized above search-and-rescue operations.\nThe dissonance between Noem\u2019s priorities and senior Coast Guard officials is a lesser-known part of the fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportations policy, and is largely playing out behind the scenes. Coast Guard officials have privately raised concerns with each other and confided in former officials about some of Noem\u2019s directives and use of Coast Guard resources to service her and the administration\u2019s priorities, the current and former Coast Guard officials said.\nAt times, the tensions have escalated into confrontations, the sources said. In one contentious incident in May, Noem\u2019s top adviser, Corey Lewandowski, berated Coast Guard flight staff and threatened to fire them for taking off without one of the secretary\u2019s personal items on board \u2014 a heated blanket, according to the current and former Coast Guard officials.\n\u201cThere is a general atmosphere of \u2018keep your head down; you don\u2019t want to be on the firing line,\u2019\u201d the former Coast Guard official said.\nA spokesperson for the Coast Guard referred all questions about the reporting in this story to DHS.\nA spokesperson for DHS denied that there was guidance to Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento that prioritized transporting immigrants first over search-and-rescue operations. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. No such guidance was ordered,\u201d the DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe Coast Guard is always ready to respond to search and rescue missions, and it carefully balances all operations and mission requirements.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said in response to this story, \u201cThe entire premise of your story is incorrect, and these attacks are nothing more than a politicized deep state effort to undermine President Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda and distract from the historic successes that the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard have achieved since he returned to office.\u201d\nThe tension between some Coast Guard officials and Noem began after a 23-year-old Coast Guardsman went overboard into the Pacific Ocean from the cutter Waesche on Feb. 4, 2025, shortly after the Senate confirmed Noem into her role, according to the two U.S. officials, the Coast Guard official and the former Coast Guard official.\nThe Coast Guard had surged ships and aircraft to the Pacific to find the Coast Guardsman. Hours into the search, Noem learned that a Coast Guard C-130 that was supposed to fly detained migrants from California to Texas was among the aircraft over the Pacific looking for the missing Coast Guardsman, and she intervened, according to the two U.S. officials and the Coast Guard official.\nNoem verbally instructed the Acting Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Kevin Lunday, to pull the plane off the search-and-rescue mission so it would not miss the migrant flight as part of the DHS\u2019s so-called Alien Expulsion Operations, according to the two U.S. officials and the Coast Guard official. Lunday notified the National Command Center, which ordered the C-130 to fly to San Diego while other aircraft and ships involved in the search continued, according to one of the U.S. officials and the current Coast Guard official.\nIn an effort to keep the C-130 searching for the missing service member, the regional Coast Guard command in San Diego scrambled to find two available C-27s that could fly the migrants to Texas, which freed up the C-130 to continue searching for the missing Coast Guardsman after about an hour, the two U.S. officials and the Coast Guard official said.\nThe search ultimately went on for 190 hours covering 19,000 square miles, but the Coast Guardsman was never found. It\u2019s not clear that Noem\u2019s directive to pull the C-130 had any impact on the search, particularly given the Coast Guard found alternative aircraft that allowed it to return to the effort.\nThe DHS spokesperson said a C-130 was shifted from migrant flights to the search-and-rescue operation in the Pacific on Feb. 4 and continued on that mission until the search was suspended. The spokesperson said \u201cthe C-130 never left the search\u201d and that there is no documentation it was diverted away from the search-and-rescue operation.\nDespite the differing narratives, the incident left Coast Guard officials with a negative impression of Noem, according to the two U.S. officials, the Coast Guard official and the former Coast Guard official. The incident reflected a clash of cultures between Noem\u2019s leadership style and Coast Guard officials, the sources said.\n\u201cThe primary mission was search-and-rescue,\u201d the former Coast Guard official said. \u201cAnd now the number one stated mission of the Coast Guard is border security, that is a cultural change that the culture hasn\u2019t quite caught up to.\u201d\nThe official added that under Noem\u2019s leadership \u201cyou never know what\u2019s going to happen\u201d and that morale at Coast Guard headquarters \u201cis terrible.\u201d\nAsked about low morale within the Coast Guard, the DHS spokesperson said, \u201cThat\u2019s armchair speculation that\u2019s out of touch with the reality in the service right now.\u201d\nThe DHS spokesperson also said the Coast Guard has used C-130 and C-27 aircraft to transport migrants \u201con an as-needed basis\u201d and said its focus on immigration \u201cis nothing new or unusual.\u201d\nUnder Noem\u2019s leadership, more than 750 Coast Guard flights have been redirected from regular missions like maritime patrols and search and rescue efforts, to instead fly detained migrants to deportation hubs, according to ICE Flight Monitor. Coast Guard flights carrying migrants jumped last year from 14 in June to 149 in November, according to the group.\nA former Republican governor of South Dakota, Noem stepped into her high-profile role with a mandate from Trump to conduct a mass deportation campaign that was the focus of her attention and that of the senators who oversaw her nomination process. Neither Noem nor any lawmaker mentioned the Coast Guard at her January 2025 confirmation hearing, and she was confirmed by the Senate with the support of seven Democrats.\nSeveral of the Democrats who voted to confirm Noem have taken issue with her management of other aspects of the department., Two \u2014 Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Andy Kim, D-N.J. \u2014 told NBC News last June that they regretted supporting her confirmation.\nNoem has increasingly been under scrutiny in recent weeks amid ongoing immigration enforcement raids in major American cities that are backed by the White House and have sparked protests. She took a leading role in the administration\u2019s public response to federal agents\u2019 fatal shootings of American citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in separate incidents in Minneapolis in January. Like other senior Trump officials, Noem quickly characterized Good and Pretti as the aggressors before any investigation into the shootings.\nWhile Trump shook up his immigration team within days of Pretti\u2019s shooting, sending border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis, he has stood by Noem. The president has rejected calls for her resignation from Democrats and some Republicans.\n\u201cLook, look she was in charge of the border,\u201d Trump told \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Tom Llamas earlier this month that Noem deserves credit for closing the border but may have a \u201cpublic relations\u201d problem. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing a very good job,\u201d he said in an Oval Office interview. \u201cShe\u2019s not getting credit for the job that she does.\u201d\nNoem, who has also rankled critics by appearing in front of detained migrants at a prison in El Salvador and budgeting $200 million for deportation ads that feature her, got off to a rocky start with some of her Coast Guard subordinates when she evicted the newly fired Commandant Linda Fagan from housing at Joint Base Anacostia Bolling with three hours\u2019 notice in February, NBC News reported.\nAt the time, Homeland Security Department officials insisted to NBC News that Fagan was not thrown out so that the housing could be provided to the secretary. Noem later moved into the home.\n\u201cSecretary Noem is paying fair market value for her temporary use of the facility as she faces heightened security threats following the publication of her apartment by a tabloid,\u201d a second DHS spokesperson said last year.\nNoem has also raised eyebrows among Coast Guard officials over her approach to traveling on Coast Guard aircraft, which is a standard practice for Homeland Security secretaries, according to the U.S. official, the Coast Guard official, the former Coast Guard official and one of the U.S. officials.\nIn October, Noem sought to replace the Coast Guard aircraft that has traditionally flown the Homeland Security secretary with two new Gulfstream jets at a cost of $170 million. Some Coast Guard officials viewed the purchase to replace the aging aircraft as an unnecessary expense, according to the two U.S. officials, the Coast Guard official, the former Coast Guard official and two DHS officials.\nThe two DHS officials said the Coast Guard officials were told by a senior DHS official not to raise their concerns about the purchase of the new Gulfstream jets.\n\u201cWe were kept completely out of the loop on those Gulfstreams. I wanted to know what money they used for those Gulfstreams,\u201d one of the DHS officials said. \u201cBut basically, we were shut down.\u201d\nDemocrats objected to the purchase of two jets, saying only one was needed and resources should instead be spent on mission aircraft such as C-130\u2019s. The top Democrats on the House Appropriations and Homeland Security committees wrote a letter to Noem in October criticizing the purchase. \u201cYour first priority should be to organize, train and equip a Coast Guard that is strong enough to meet today\u2019s mission requirements,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cInstead, it appears your first priority is your own comfort.\u201d\nNoem has defended the decision, saying the new jets were needed to support Coast Guard missions and noted that Congress appropriated the funding for them.\nThe DHS spokesperson said the department received one of the Gulfstream jets last month and is expected to receive the second one this fall. \u201cThese aircraft are the products of a planned, and long-needed update to the Coast Guard\u2019s long-range command and control aircraft, which are essential for mission readiness and safety,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that they are for senior DHS and military officials.\nNoem recently flew on one of the newly purchased Gulfstreams to Phoenix, Ariz., to tout DHS\u2019s accomplishments on the southern border over the past year.\nTypically, government planes that are used for members of the executive branch\u2019s travel are returned to what is called a \u201csterile state\u201d after each flight, which includes the removal of all personal items of the individuals who had traveled on it, according to the U.S. official.\nBut Noem liked the idea of keeping some personal items on board, including a heated blanket, for her convenience, so a storage cabinet on the aircraft was reserved for that purpose in a way that ran counter to typical protocols for most government aircraft, one of the U.S. officials and the current Coast Guard official said.\n\u201cThe claim that the secretary would misuse government property is ridiculous,\u201d the DHS spokesperson said. \u201cSecretary Noem is most conscientious steward of government resources DHS has ever had.\u201d\nNoem\u2019s team clashed with Coast Guard staff last year after the Coast Guard plane she\u2019d been flying on broke down and she had to fly back to Washington, D.C., on a back-up jet, according to the two U.S. officials, the Coast Guard official , and the former Coast Guard official.\nWhile flying on the back up plane, Noem realized she had left some personal items, including her blanket, on the plane that had broken down, the two U.S. officials, the Coast Guard official and the former Coast Guard official said.\nWhen Noem\u2019s top adviser, Corey Lewandowski, was informed that some of her personal items had been left behind, he yelled at the Coast Guard flight staff and threatened to fire them, according to the two U.S. officials, the Coast Guard official and the former Coast Guard official.\nThe Coast Guard pilot came out of the cockpit to see what was happening, and Lewandowski insisted the plane return to where the broken-down jet was located to collect the secretary\u2019s items, the U.S. official, the current Coast Guard official and the former Coast Guard official said.\nWhen the pilot refused, Lewandowski announced the pilot was relieved of duty, according to the U.S. official, the current Coast Guard official and the former Coast official. The pilot explained that if he was fired he would need to land the plane immediately while another pilot was found to continue the mission to Washington, the U.S. official, the current Coast Guard official and the former Coast Guard official said.\nLewandowski ultimately relented and calmer heads prevailed by the end of the trip, the two U.S. officials, the current U.S. official and the former Coast Guard official said. The Wall Street Journal reported some details of the confrontation on Friday.\nWhile the DHS spokesperson responded in an email exchange to questions about other elements of this story, the spokesperson did not provide answers to questions about the confrontation between Lewandowski and Coast Guard staff on this flight."

      "raw_text": "Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the U.S. that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.\nIran and the U.S. renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation. The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, U.S. officials have told Reuters.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement, while making clear that may not happen.\n\"No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we're going to try,\" Rubio said.\nIran has threatened to strike U.S. bases in the Middle East if it is attacked by U.S. forces but on Sunday took a conciliatory line.\n\"For the sake of an agreement's durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,\" foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.\n\"Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,\" Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured U.S. economic interests.\nIn 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran.\nOn Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday.\n\"Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we'll see how that turns out,\" Rubio said, without providing further details.\nWhile talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.\nIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi left Tehran for Geneva to take part in the indirect nuclear talks with the U.S. and meet the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and others, his ministry said.\nOpen to compromise\nDeputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signalled Iran's readiness to compromise on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was \"in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal.\"\nThe senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief's statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran's flexibility.\nHowever, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.\nIn June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites.\nThe U.S. is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran's oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.\nChina accounts for more than 80% of Iran's oil exports so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran's oil revenue.\nNetanyahu: Dismantle Iran nuclear infrastructure\nNetanyahu said on Sunday he told U.S. President Donald Trump last week that any U.S. deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.\nSpeaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Netanyahu also said Israel still needs to \"complete the job\" of destroying all tunnels in Gaza. Israel, he said, has already dismantled 150 km (93 miles) of an estimated 500 km.\nNetanyahu said he is skeptical of a U.S. deal with Iran but said it must include enriched material leaving Iran. \"There shall be no enrichment capability \u2014 not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place,\" he said.\nNetanyahu also said that he aimed to end U.S. military aid to Israel within the next 10 years, after the current 10-year deal of receiving $3.8 billion a year \u2014 which is largely spent in the United States on equipment \u2014 ends in 2028.\nDue to a thriving economy, \"we can afford to phase out the financial component of the military aid that we're receiving, and I propose a 10-year drawdown to zero. Now, in the three years that remain in the present memorandum of understanding and another seven years draw it down to zero,\" Netanyahu said.\n\"We want to move with the United States from aid to partnership,\" he said."
