      "raw_text": "Iran meets UN nuclear watchdog in Geneva ahead of more US talks\nIran meets UN nuclear watchdog in Geneva ahead of more US talks\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s top diplomat met with the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency Monday, ahead of a second round of negotiations with the United States over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and said he would also meet with Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi of Oman, which is hosting the U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva on Tuesday.\n\u201cI am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal,\u201d Araghchi wrote on X. \u201cWhat is not on the table: submission before threats.\u201d\nAs U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an additional aircraft carrier to the region, Iran on Monday held another naval drill, state TV reported. It said the drill would test Iran\u2019s intelligence and operational capabilities in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.\nIran\u2019s drills take place against the US military buildup\nJust before the talks, Iran announced its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard started the drill early Monday morning in the waterways that are crucial international trade routes through which 20% of the world\u2019s oil passes.\nSeparately, EOS Risk Group said sailors passing through the region received by radio a warning that the northern lane of the Strait of Hormuz, in Iranian territorial waters, likely would see a live-fire drill Tuesday. Iranian state TV did not mention the live fire drill.\nThis is the second time in recent weeks sailors have received warning about an Iranian live fire drill. During the previous exercise, announced at the end of January, the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command issued a strongly worded warning to Iran and the Revolutionary Guard. While acknowledging Iran\u2019s \u201cright to operate professionally in international airspace and waters,\u201d it warned against interfering or threatening American warships or passing commercial vessels.\nOn Feb. 4, tensions between the Iranian and U.S. navies rose further after a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down an Iranian drone that was approaching the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea. Iran also harassed a U.S.-flagged and U.S.-crewed merchant vessel that was sailing in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. military reported.\nIran open to compromise in exchange for sanctions relief\nThe Trump administration is seeking a deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program and ensure it does not develop nuclear weapons. On Sunday, Iran\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled that Tehran could be open to compromise on the nuclear issue, but is looking for an easing of international sanctions led by the United States.\n\u201cThe ball is in America\u2019s court. They have to prove they want to have a deal with us,\u201d Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC. \u201cIf we see a sincerity on their part, I am sure that we will be on a road to have an agreement.\u201d\n\u201cWe are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our program provided that they are also ready to talk about the sanctions,\u201d he added.\nTalking to reporters Monday night aboard Air Force One on his way to Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump said of the U.S.-Iran talks, \u201cI\u2019ll be involved in those talks -- indirectly -- and they\u2019ll be very important, and we\u2019ll see what can happen.\u201d\n\u201cTypically, Iran\u2019s a very tough negotiator,\u201d he said, first describing Iran as \u201cgood negotiators\u201d before correcting himself. \u201cI would say they\u2019re bad negotiators, because we could have had a deal instead of sending the B2s in to knock out their nuclear potential, and we had to send the B2s. I hope they\u2019re going to be more reasonable.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cI think they want to make a deal. I don\u2019t think they want the consequences of not making a deal.\u201d\nOman hosted a first round of indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran on Feb. 6.\nSimilar talks last year between the U.S. and Iran about Iran\u2019s nuclear program broke down after Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran, that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.\nThe U.S. is also hosting talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday, days ahead of the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor.\nUS keeps military pressure high\nTrump initially threatened to take military action over Iran\u2019s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, but then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, visiting Budapest, reiterated on Monday that the U.S. hopes to achieve a deal with Iran, despite the difficulties. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge these talks,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.\u201d\nTrump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran \u201cwould be the best thing that could happen.\u201d\nIran has said if the U.S. attacks, it will respond with an attack of its own.\nThe Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any deal. Tehran says it won\u2019t agree to that.\nIran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.\nThe direct meeting with Grossi is a significant step after Iran suspended all cooperation with the IAEA following the June war with Israel. The two also met briefly on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September. The IAEA said it has been unable to verify the status of Iran\u2019s near weapons-grade uranium stockpile since the war. Iran has allowed IAEA some access to sites that were not damaged, but has not allowed inspectors to visit other sites.\nIran\u2019s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% could allow Iran to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program, Grossi previously told The Associated Press. He added that it doesn\u2019t mean that Iran has such a weapon.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to Washington last week to urge Trump to ensure that any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.\n___\nLiechtenstein reported from Vienna.

Crews are responding to the scene.\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles is monitoring a line of storms that could potentially produce waterspouts.\nThey've issued a Special Marine Warning for the East Santa Barbara Channel from Point Conception to Point Mugu, including Santa Cruz Island.\nThe warning remains in effect through 3:15 p.m. PST. It states that waterspouts have already been located near Point Mugu.\nWaterspouts can easily overturn boats and create locally hazardous seas, according to the National Weather Service.\nFirefighters rescued a man and woman who became stranded on a remote bank with no road or trail access earlier today.\nSeveral agencies were involved in the rescue, which took place at Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park.\nCrews were notified that two rafters were in distress passing through the state park on the San Lorenzo River.\nA woman in her 50s sustained an injury during the incident, but crews were eventually able to locate her and the man.\nFirefighters hiked through rough terrain to reach the man and woman, who were on the opposite side of the river. California State Parks sent out rescue swimmers who reached them and brought the duo safely across the river to receive care.\nFire officials said that when the river runs high, conditions can change quickly.\n\"Leave the high-flow navigation to the professionals with the dry suits and specialized training,\" CAL Fire San Mateo - Santa Cruz Unit said on social media.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol is enforcing chain control, also known as traction law, in parts of the state as massive amounts of snow are expected to fall in Sierra Nevada.\nTraction laws are usually carried out in severe weather conditions, such as heavy snow and ice, to improve safety.\nChain control is already in effect for SR-168 at Shaver Lake Marina, Highway 50, Interstate 80, Lewis Creek and the San Bernardino mountains.\n\"If you're heading to snow elevations, carry properly fitted tire chains, and know how to install them,\" California High Patrol Fresno said on social media.\nA massive winter storm has brought travel to a standstill on Interstate 80, as authorities have officially held all traffic in both directions across the Sierra Nevada.\nThe Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) is holding all eastbound traffic at the state line, while Caltrans has shut down westbound lanes as far down as Colfax.\nThe closure follows a wave of dangerous spinouts and multiple vehicle crashes as heavy snow hammers the summit.\nWith visibility near zero and the roadway slick with ice, officials warn of significant delays that could last several hours.\nCrews are working 24/7 to clear the wreckage and plow the lanes, but conditions remain treacherous.\nFirefighters were forced to perform a dramatic rescue in the Sawtelle neighborhood late Monday morning after torrential rains transformed a busy intersection into a lake.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the intersection of West Olympic Boulevard and Sawtelle Boulevard at 11:27 AM, where seven vehicles had become hopelessly stalled in deep floodwaters.\nFirefighters from Station 59 assisted at least one person from their vehicle to safety.\nFortunately, no injuries have been reported, but the intersection remains closed until the floodwaters recede.\nLAPD and LAFD are urging drivers to seek alternate routes and avoid the area.\nMultiple reports of flooding and downed trees are coming into the FOX Forecast Center this afternoon as a powerful storm slams California.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol says it is responding to multiple reports of flooding and downed trees in and around Los Angeles.\nHeavy rain is slamming the area with rain rates reaching up to 1 inch per hour.\nThe FOX Forecast Center is monitoring coastal sections of southern California for potential flash flooding this afternoon.\nRain rates could reach up to one inch per hour through the afternoon, triggering flash flooding in urban areas and in burn scar areas near Los Angeles.\nExtreme rain rates of two inches per hour are currently hammering Santa Monica, triggering immediate flash flood concerns across the coastal city.\n.67\" of rain was recorded in Santa Monica in just 20 minutes.\nThis torrential downpour is creating life-threatening conditions on major roadways like the Pacific Coast Highway, where rapid runoff and deep ponding could make travel nearly impossible.\nLocal officials are urging residents to shelter in place as the storm intensifies, warning that this volume of water can quickly overwhelm drainage systems and lead to dangerous debris flows.\nA ground stop has been issued for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) until 3 p.m. ET as a powerful Pacific storm brings treacherous conditions to Southern California.\nSevere storms hammering the Los Angeles area are combining with low cloud ceilings, forcing the FAA to halt inbound traffic from airports across the West to maintain safety.\nThis disruption at one of the nation's busiest hubs is expected to cause a significant ripple effect, leading to mounting delays and cancellations for travelers across the West Coast on this busy Presidents Day Monday.\nAirport officials are urging all passengers to verify their flight status with their airlines before heading to the terminal, as taxi times and gate holds for departing flights are also increasing due to the severe weather.\nTravel at San Diego International Airport (SAN) is grinding to a halt as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a ground stop for flights.\nThe disruption comes as a powerful Pacific storm moves into San Diego County, bringing with it high winds, low visibility, and heavy rain.\nInbound flights from airports across the West are being held at their departure airports until 3:15 p.m. ET due to high winds and low ceilings (cloud cover) creating hazardous landing conditions.\nOutbound flights are currently experiencing significant gate holds and taxi delays, with some aircraft waiting on the tarmac for over an hour.\nWith the ground stop in place, a \"ripple effect\" of delays is expected throughout the afternoon and evening across the West Coast.\nTravelers are reporting over two dozen cancellations and a growing list of delays on the flight boards at Lindbergh Field.The National Weather Service has warned that this is only the first of two waves of moisture expected to hit the region this week.\nA dangerous situation for commuters in Santa Barbara County has shut down a major artery of Highway 101 Monday morning after a massive tree crashed across the roadway.\nThe incident is causing significant backups near Goleta as a potent storm system brings damaging winds and heavy rain to the Central Coast.\nThe California Highway Patrol says multiple downed trees have been reported on the 101 in the area, slowing down travel in the area.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for central and southern Los Angeles County until 12:15 p.m. PT.\nA line of severe thunderstorms extending from Encino to 14 miles northwest of Two Harbors is moving northeast at 40 mph.\nDamaging winds to 60 mph are expected and a brief tornado is possible.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) in Los Angeles/Oxnard has issued a Flash Flood Warning for the Santa Monica Mountains and southwestern Los Angeles County until 2:00 p.m. PT.\nRadar indicates heavy rain sweeping across the warned area and rain rates are currently estimated between 0.5 and 1 inch per hour. The NWS warns that flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\nThe warning specifically highlights the Palisades and Franklin burn scars. These areas are at extreme risk for debris flows, where rapidly moving water can pick up loose soil, rocks, and vegetation.\nInterstate 405 through the Sepulveda Pass is included in the warning and drivers should expect dangerous hydroplaning conditions and potential closures in the area.\nIf you are in the warned area, stay off the roads if possible. The combination of heavy rain and potential mudslides makes travel through the canyons treacherous.\nEmergency crews are working to clear a large tree that fell across the southbound lanes of Highway 101 near Santa Barbara.\nRight now, all southbound lanes are shut down and traffic is being diverted by California Highway Patrol.\nThere is no word on how long it'll take to clear the downed tree from the highway.\nIn a proactive move to protect public safety, Caltrans implemented a full closure of a critical 3.6-mile stretch of Topanga Canyon Boulevard (State Route 27).\nThis shutdown, affecting the road between Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) and Grand View Drive, is a direct response to the heavy rain threatening the active Palisades Fire recovery work zone.\nWhile 8 to 10 feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada sounds like a lot to shovel, for the rest of California and the West, it is exactly what the doctor ordered.\nAfter a record-breaking snow drought left the mountains looking more like early spring than mid-winter, this week's massive storm is providing a critical rescue for our water future.\nBefore this storm hit, the West was in a dire situation. Just last week, snow cover across the western U.S. was roughly one-third of what it typically is for mid-February. Some parts of the West were seeing snowpack levels as bad as they have been in recorded history for this time of year.\nThe Sierra snowpack normally provides about 30% of California\u2019s water needs. Without a significant winter deposit in this mountain bank account, the state faces much higher risks of drought and water shortages in the summer.\nBy the beginning of February, statewide snowpack in California had plummeted to just 56% to 59% of average for the date. Water managers keep a close eye on April 1, which is when the snowpack usually peaks.\nEvery day it doesn't snow, that average drops further. This week\u2019s series of storms are a massive step toward catching back up to normal levels before the spring melt begins.\nSnow isn't just about what we drink; it\u2019s also about protecting forests. A deep, healthy snowpack acts as a slow-release watering system, keeping the ground and vegetation moist well into the summer.\nWhen snow disappears too early, the landscape dries out faster, which can kick-start an early and more intense wildfire season. This 8-foot blanket of snow helps keep that risk at bay for longer.\nThis week\u2019s storm is more than just a winter wonderland; it\u2019s a vital lifeline for California's farms, cities, and ecosystems.\nPSE&G says thousands of its customers are without power right now as a powerful storm slams California.\nAccording to PowerOutage.com, the worst outages are occurring in Calaveras County where more than 3,000 customers are without electricity right now.\nHeavy rain and gusty winds pounded northern California late Sunday and early Monday. California Highway Patrol reports some trees were downed and roads were flooded following the storm.\nFlooding reports are coming into the FOX Forecast Center after hours of heavy rain have hammered California. The rain is expected to continue through the day, which could lead to additional flooding across the state.\nTravelers at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) are facing significant disruptions as a powerful storm forces the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to slow operations.\nThe FAA has implemented a ground delay program for arriving traffic due to low ceilings, rain, and gusty winds. Average delays are near 30 minutes, but some incoming flights are now seeing delays exceeding 2 to 4 hours.\nDozens of flights have already been delayed today and that number is expected to increase through the day.\nPeople along the Central Coast this morning should keep an eye on the horizon. The FOX Forecast Center is tracking weak showers moving north toward western Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.\nWhile these showers aren't producing much lightning, meteorologists are seeing just enough \"spin\" in the atmosphere to allow for brief, weak waterspouts and sudden, damaging wind gusts along the shore.\nThese showers are moving within a plume of warm air ahead of a much larger storm front that is set to bring heavy rain and high winds to the region today.\nThe threat is mostly right at the coastline and isn't expected to move far inland over the next few hours. Because this is a very localized and short-lived setup, the Storm Prediction Center isn't planning to issue a widespread Tornado or Severe Thunderstorm Watch for this specific threat.\nCalifornia is bracing for a powerhouse weather event this Monday as a \"significant and dangerous\" storm sweeps across the state. While heavy rain and snow are grabbing headlines, the FOX Forecast Center is tracking a surge of damaging winds that could bring life to a standstill from the coast to the high desert.\nThe latest exclusive FOX Weather Model data highlights a widespread threat of intense gusts through Tuesday. Peak gusts between 60\u2013100 mph are possible for higher elevations and mountain passes, where dangerous winds will create major to impossible travel conditions.\nLos Angeles, San Diego, and Palm Springs are forecast to see gusts in the 50\u201360 mph range, powerful enough to down tree limbs and trigger isolated power outages.\nHigh Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories are in effect for the state, warning residents to be on guard for falling trees, power lines, flying debris, and property damage.\nLos Angeles is entering a significant and dangerous weather period as a series of storms takes aim at the Southland. The National Weather Service has placed the region on high alert for heavy rain that could trigger flash flooding and debris flows through the workweek.\nBecause of the heavy rainfall rates\u2014expected to exceed 0.5 inches per hour\u2014officials have issued a Flood Watch for a wide swath of LA County. Evacuation warnings are currently in effect for those living near recent burn scars, such as the Palisades and Sunset Fire areas, where the risk of mudslides is significantly elevated.\nA powerful storm is currently strengthening over Southern California, and while that sounds like just another rainy day, there is some serious science making this one particularly dangerous.\nConditions are expected to rapidly deteriorate over the coming hours. Right now, the atmosphere is shifting from providing a beneficial rain to posing a genuine flood hazard. As significant moisture surges toward the California coast, the rain amounts and intensities will increase through the day.\nThe biggest concern isn't just how much rain falls, but how fast it comes down. We are expecting rates of 0.5 to 0.75 inches per hour, with some spots seeing up to 1 inch locally.\nAnything over 0.30 inches per hour is considered \"heavy\" rain. A rate of 1 inch per hour is intense enough to overwhelm storm drains and fill neighborhood streets faster than they can drain.\nThe storm is slamming into the Transverse Ranges\u2014mountain chains like the San Gabriels and Santa Monicas that run east-to-west. When moist air hits these mountains, it is forced upward in a process called orographic lift. This acts like \"wringing out a sponge,\" causing much heavier rain on the mountain slopes than at the coast. This is why mountain areas could see 3\u20135 inches of total rain today while coastal areas see 1\u20132 inches.\nIf you live near an area recently hit by wildfires, like the Sunset or Palisades fire zones, you are at the highest risk. Burned soil becomes water-repellant, acting more like pavement than dirt.\nIt only takes about 0.5 inches of rain in an hour to trigger a debris flow\u2014a fast-moving landslide of mud, rocks, and trees. These are unpredictable and can move faster than a person can run.\nThe worst of the rain and the peak flash flood risk are expected to reach the Los Angeles Metro area after 10:00 a.m. PT and linger into early Tuesday.\nWhile California is better known for its sunshine and seismic activity, a rare winter severe weather threat is taking center stage today. As a powerful storm funnels deep moisture into the state, FOX Weather meteorologists are warning that the Los Angeles Basin and surrounding coastal areas could see more than just heavy rain\u2014they could see tornadoes.\nTornadoes in California are historically rare, especially in winter, but today\u2019s major system is providing an unusual mix of atmospheric ingredients.\nA powerful low-level jet is screaming across the region, creating the spin necessary to turn ordinary thunderstorms into rotating ones.\nAs a cold front moves onshore, a dangerous squall line is expected to form. This line of storms can tap into strong winds aloft, bringing the potential for downburst winds exceeding 60 mph and brief weak tornadoes.\nAnd with intense energy over the Pacific, waterspouts are likely to form offshore. Any of these that cross the coastline can become land-bound tornadoes, particularly along the Los Angeles and Ventura County coasts.\nA powerful storm is slamming Los Angeles today, triggering an urgent Flood Watch as heavy rainfall threatens to transform streets into rivers. The FOX Forecast Center warns that the most intense window for the storm is between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. PT today, with rain rates potentially reaching 0.5 to 1.0 inch per hour.\nExcessive runoff is expected to flood low-lying areas, including freeways, urban streets, and neighborhoods with poor drainage. Creeks, streams, and rivers across the LA Basin are likely to rise rapidly, and low-water crossings may become impassable. Intense rain on steep terrain is expected to trigger rock and mudslides, making travel through canyons particularly dangerous.\nThe Sierra Nevada is currently in the crosshairs of a powerhouse multi-day storm system that meteorologists describe as the most significant snow event of the season.\nWhile California has enjoyed a spring-like start to 2026, winter has returned with a vengeance, threatening to bury mountain communities under staggering amounts of snow through midweek.\nFOX Weather meteorologists are warning of extraordinary accumulation across the range as two Pacific storms merge into a prolonged period of intense precipitation. The most intense projections suggest a total of 120 inches (10 feet) could fall in high-elevation terrain over the next week, while widespread totals of 6 to 8 feet are expected for areas above 5,000 feet.\nPopular destinations like Palisades Tahoe and Sugar Bowl are bracing for over 60 inches of fresh powder by Wednesday, and even lower-elevation communities at 3,000 feet could see up to 2 feet of snow as levels plunge.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning valid through Wednesday, classifying the impact as \"major.\" Heavy bursts of snow falling at rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour, combined with wind gusts over 100 mph along ridge tops, will create zero visibility and whiteout conditions. Travel over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit is expected to become impossible as feet of snow pile up on the roadway.\nMountain operations teams are already conducting avalanche mitigation, and visitors should expect wind holds and delayed lift openings at all major resorts. While this is the snowpack California desperately needs for its water supply, officials urge everyone to stay off mountain roads until the system clears late Wednesday night.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) has issued widespread evacuation warnings for residents living near several recent burn scars as a powerful storm slams Southern California.\nThe warnings are in effect until 9 a.m. PT Tuesday and target areas at high risk for life-threatening debris flows and mudslides.\nClick here for the latest LAFD alerts.\nResidents in the following zones should be prepared to leave immediately if an evacuation order is issued:\n- Palisades Fire Burn Scar: Specifically zones LFD-1081, 1083, 1085, 1087, 1089, 1091, 1092, 1093, 1095, 1096, 1097, and 0891.\n- Hurst Fire Burn Scar: Zone LFD-0001-B in the Sylmar area.\n- Sunset Fire Burn Scar: Zone LFD-0835 in the Hollywood Hills.\nLive Coverage begins here"

      "raw_text": "US build-up of warships and fighter jets tracked near Iran\nBBC Verify has confirmed the location of US aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln near Iran using satellite imagery, as Washington continues to put pressure on the country over its military program and recent deadly crackdown on protesters.\nUS and Iranian officials are set to meet in Swizerland on Tuesday for a second round of talks. Iran says the meeting will focus on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the US. Washington has previously indicated it wants to discuss other issues as well.\nThe Abraham Lincoln, which leads a strike group with three guided missile destroyers, carries 90 aircraft including F35 fighters, and 5,680 crew, was reportedly deployed to the Gulf region in late January but has not been seen in satellite imagery until now. It has been located off the coast of Oman, around 700km from Iran.\nThe US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, which could arrive in the region within the next three weeks.\nThe Abraham Lincoln's arrival adds to what we know about the current US military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks, where BBC Verify has tracked an increase of US destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets in the region.\nWhat military assets has the US moved into the Middle East?\nPublicly available images from the European Sentinel-2 satellites show Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea around 150 miles (240km) off the coast of Oman.\nIt had not been seen since it reportedly entered the region in January but it had been crossing the open sea where satellite coverage is limited. Military assets on land are more visible and frequently captured on satellite.\nIt means we have now tracked 12 US ships in the Middle East through satellite imagery: the Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered Nimitz-class carrier, which together with three Arleigh Burke class destroyers forms a carrier strike group; plus two destroyers capable of carrying out long-range missile strikes and three specialist ships for combat near to the shore that are currently positioned at Bahrain naval station in the Gulf. Two other destroyers have been seen in the eastern Mediterranean near the Souda Bay US base, and one more in the Red Sea.\nWe have also been following the movements of US aircraft in the region, where we have seen an increase of F-15 and EA-18 fighter jets stationed in Muwaffaq Salti military base in Jordan, and an increase in US cargo planes and refuelling and communications aircraft moving towards the Middle East from the US and Europe.\nHow has Iran responded?\nThe US Central Command released images of the Abraham Lincoln flanked by destroyers, fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and coastguard vessels in the Arabian Sea in an apparent show of military prowess on 6 February, which Iran has met with its own show of force.\nOn Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The drill saw IRGC Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief Maj Gen Mohammad Pakpour inspecting naval vessels at a harbour before missiles are seen launching from a ship, the IRCG-linked Tasnim News Agency reported.\nThe Strait is considered one of the world's most important shipping routes and a vital oil transit choke point. Around a fifth of the world's oil and gas flows through the Strait, including from Kharg Island, Iran's main oil export terminal. Pakpour was seen flying over the island in a helicopter in the report showing Iran's latest military manoeuvres.\nHow does it compare with Venezuela and Operation Midnight Hammer?\nMilitary intelligence expert Justin Crump told BBC Verify that the current US military preparations in the Middle East show \"more depth and sustainability\" than its manoeuvres ahead of the seizure of former Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro in January, or the operation carrying out air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last June.\nThey all feature a carrier strike group and several destroyers operating independently. However, the US deployed its assets in Venezuela and Iran last year under quite different circumstances.\nThe US deployed the Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean ahead of its strikes on Venezuela, one of eight warships we tracked in the region at the time, though it used fewer aircraft as it could easily send jets from surrounding US bases on America's mainland or from its base in Puerto Rico instead. The US also deployed amphibious assault ships within the Caribbean, which can be used as launch platforms for helicopter operations as was seen with the capture of Maduro. But Venezuela's military is generally seen as less capable of defending itself or retaliating against the US.\nWhen the US struck Iran last year in Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities, it was attacking a country with a much more powerful military than Venezuela. Iran's military is capable of hitting US bases across the Middle East.\nDuring Midnight Hammer the US had two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, five destroyers placed in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and three combat ships in the Gulf. It had also moved squadrons of fighter jets and refuelling aircraft from the US to Europe, but the B2 stealth bomber flights that were used to hit the Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites actually took off from US bases in Missouri.\nCrump, chief executive of risk and intelligence company Sibylline, said the build-up of US warships and aircraft, as well as eight existing airbases in the region would allow it to conduct a \"fairly intensive and sustained strike rate\" of about 800 sorties a day, with the aim of rendering any Iranian responses \"ineffective\".\n\"What we are seeing isn't just strike preparation, but rather a broader deterrent deployment capable of being scaled up or down,\" he said. \"This means it has more depth and sustainability than the force packages arranged for either Venezuela or Midnight Hammer last year. It's designed to sustain an engagement and counter all potential responses against US assets in the region and, of course, Israel.\"\nAdditional reporting by Barbara Metzler, Ghoncheh Habibiazad, Thomas Copeland, Yi Ma"
