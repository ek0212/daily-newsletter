      "raw_text": "Wayve\u2019s self-driving tech has attracted a diverse set of investors in the company\u2019s latest $1.2 billion funding round, including three automakers, top venture and institutional firms, and returning backers Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber. The total raise could reach $1.5 billion thanks to another $300 million from Uber contingent on deploying robotaxis, beginning in London.\nEveryone, it seems, wants a piece of the U.K. startup, which is now valued at $8.6 billion. The funding round illustrates the eagerness among Big Tech, legacy automakers, and the investor community to profit from the burgeoning automated driving industry.\nWayve provides what founder and CEO Alex Kendall calls the \u201ccontrarian\u201d option in automated driving \u2014 contrarian both in its approach to tech and its business model, he told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday.\n\u201cI think the technology chessboard is set around where different companies have invested on the technology strategy, and now the commercial chessboard is being arranged,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cWe took a very contrarian view on the technology side. We were the first to build end-to-end deep learning for autonomous driving, and we pioneered this approach. Now, when it comes to this phase of moving into commercialization, we\u2019re also taking a contrarian business model approach.\u201d\nWayve, which launched in 2017, uses a self-learning approach to its software. The company developed a software layer using an end-to-end neural network that doesn\u2019t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive.\nThis data-driven learning approach underpins two products: an \u201ceyes on\u201d assisted-driving system and an \u201ceyes off\u201d fully automated-driving system that could be applied to robotaxis or consumer vehicles that can handle all of the driving in certain environments.\nThe company\u2019s pitch to customers is the agnostic nature of its technology, which is not reliant on specific sensors or maps. The automated-driving software captures data from whatever sensors are on the vehicle and directs the system\u2019s driving decisions. Wayve\u2019s software can also run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles.\nSave up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit\n1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Learn from founders and investors who have shaped the industry. Connect with peers navigating similar growth stages. Walk away with tactics you can apply immediately\nOffer ends March 13.\nIt should be noted, however, that Nvidia, which is also a backer, has had a close development relationship with Wayve since 2018. The startup\u2019s Gen 3 platform, which was unveiled last fall, uses an in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The Gen 3 platform will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 \u2014 or fully driverless \u2014 features that will work on city streets and highways.\nThe company\u2019s tech is somewhat similar to how Tesla has approached automated driving, although there are key differences in their business models.\nWayve doesn\u2019t want to be the operator of its hands-free driving-assistance system or its \u201ceyes-off\u201d fully automated-driving system. (For comparison, Waymo is largely the operator of its robotaxis, although it does have partners.) Nor does Wayve want to build vehicles bundled with its own software, as Tesla does. Instead, it is selling its \u201cembodied AI\u201d to automakers and other tech companies like Uber.\nKendall argues that this is the business model with the largest addressable market, but he says it\u2019s only viable because Wayve built an AI that generalizes across different hardware and environments.\n\u201cIf you build an autonomy stack that\u2019s specific to a sensor or compute architecture, [or] if you build it where it requires mapping or something like this, then you can\u2019t take option three,\u201d Kendall said, referring to the business model his company has chosen.\nNissan and Uber are both Wayve customers. Nissan said the startup\u2019s self-driving software will be used to beef up the advanced driver-assistance system in its cars starting in 2027. Meanwhile, later this year, Uber plans to launch commercial trials in vehicles equipped with Wayve\u2019s software.\nIts relationship with Uber appears poised to stretch well beyond a pilot program, though. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s statement Tuesday hints at the scope of its partnership with and investment in Wayve.\n\u201cWe are very proud to continue to deepen our partnership with Wayve, with plans to deploy together in more than 10 markets around the world. Wayve\u2019s powerful end-to-end approach is purpose-built for scale, safety, and effectiveness, and we\u2019re excited to work with them across multiple OEMs and geographies, which we\u2019ll share more about soon.\u201d\nThe round was led by Eclipse, Balderton, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. New investors include the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan, Baillie Gifford, British Business Bank, Icehouse Ventures, Schroders Capital, and other global institutional investors, the company said.\nGlobal automakers Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis \u2014 all of which plan to use Wayve\u2019s technology \u2014 also participated. Nvidia, which participated in Wayve\u2019s $1.05 billion Series C round, said last year it was evaluating a $500 million strategic investment in Wayve\u2019s next raise. While Nvidia did participate, Kendall wouldn\u2019t disclose the exact amount of its investment or whether it came close to that $500 million figure.\nUpdated to include more information on the $300 million in additional funding from Uber.",

S&P 500 futures added 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures gained about 0.2%.\nMajor stock averages rose on Tuesday as fears about artificial intelligence disruption across several industries dissipated. The S&P 500 finished the session higher by nearly 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped about 1%. The 30-stock Dow gained 370 points, or about 0.8%.\nLifting the broader market was a nearly 9% gain in Advanced Micro Devices, which rose after Meta Platforms announced a multiyear deal with the semiconductor company. Software and cybersecurity stocks also saw a relief rally in the regular session after Anthropic launched a new connectors and plugins for its knowledge worker tool, Claude Cowork, that will allow companies to connect the AI tool to their existing apps such as Google Drive. Claude Cowork rattled the software sector in recent weeks as investors feared the tool would disrupt incumbent software vendors' businesses.\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) added 1.9% on Tuesday, though it remains down by more than 25% this year.\n\"I think that it's been indiscriminate to a point where, yes, it's gotten a little irrational ... there's room here for a little bit of a correction upward in some of these names,\" said Liz Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi, said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" referring to the plunge in software this year.\nTuesday's moves come ahead of Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, as well as results from software giant Salesforce and Snowflake, due after Wednesday's market close. Results from Nvidia come at a time when investors are recalibrating lofty tech stock valuations and growing skeptical on hyperscalers' high AI capital expenditures.\nFor Thomas, Nvidia's results could still be make-or-break for the direction of the U.S. stock market, but they have overall slightly diminished in importance given the recent panic in software and attention on rapidly developing AI tools, such as Claude.\n\"Numerically, the importance of Nvidia still remains ... They need to beat probably; they need to have positive guidance in order for market sentiment to remain intact,\" Thomas told CNBC. She added, however, that \"I don't think we're hinging as much on it\" compared to previous quarters.\nSeparately, investors this week are keeping an eye on tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

      "raw_text": "When a horse whinnies, there's more than meets the ear\nElodie Briefer grew up in the countryside near Geneva \u2014 and horses have long been a part of her world.\n\"I was riding horses when I was young,\" she recalls. \"I can't remember at which age I started, but maybe 6 or 7 years old. I did few competitions, but I was never a big fan of that. I would prefer to go for a walk with the horse and enjoy.\"\nAll this time with horses means that Briefer, now an animal behavioral scientist at the University of Copenhagen, has heard a lot of whinnying over the years. She never noticed anything out of the ordinary until a little more than a decade ago when she was working on a project that involved comparing how different animals, including horses, express themselves vocally.\n\"The first time I really listened to a horse whinny that I had recorded,\" she says, \"I was confused because I thought there were two horses \u2014 as if there [were] two voices at the same time.\"\nBriefer created a visual representation of the sound file, called a spectrogram, to inspect the whinny more closely. And that's when she saw two frequencies occurring at the same time: one high and one low.\nIn a paper appearing in the journal Current Biology, Briefer and her colleagues present a set of experiments that reveal how horses manage to create these two tones simultaneously. It's a complex feat that seems to be made possible by the anatomy of their vocal tract.\nA puzzle worth solving\nBriefer was perplexed by what she observed in the whinny for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, larger animals tend to produce lower vocalizations, and the high-pitched part of the horse whinny seemed too high for such a big creature.\nSecond, a fair number of birds can produce two simultaneous frequencies like this. But among mammals, \"it's quite uncommon, at least when it appears all the time in one type of sound,\" says Briefer.\nSo she decided to investigate how horses do it. Briefer first went to a Swiss stud farm (where her sister, who's a co-author on the study, works). She threaded a small camera down the noses of 10 breeding stallions until it was just above the larynx. It's the same procedure that's routinely conducted on these animals as part of their physical checkups, so they were accustomed to it.\nBriefer then played the stallions the sound of a female whinnying, or in certain instances, she paraded a mare in front of them. \"And then they started whinnying, so we could actually see what's going on,\" she says.\nShe noticed how the vocal folds of the larynx vibrated (just like when we speak) to produce the low-frequency part of the whinny.\nIn addition, just above the larynx, horses have strong cartilage. The video revealed the cartilage constricting, creating a small opening that likely produced a whistle \u2014 the high-frequency part of the whinny.\nBriefer had her first evidence that two different parts of the horse's vocal anatomy were likely operating in tandem to produce the whinny's two distinct frequencies.\nA rich and unique blend\nNext, Briefer's colleagues connected with a butcher in France, a country where people eat horses. \"I know it's not the same in every country,\" she says, \"but there it's quite common.\"\nThe butcher provided the team with half a dozen horse larynges. \"And then you blow air through it to reproduce the sounds,\" says Briefer.\nThey successfully generated both the low and high tones in the excised larynges, confirming the results on the stud farm. Then, when they blew helium through them, the low pitch was unaffected, but the high pitch shifted higher.\nThat's what Briefer and her colleagues were expecting, since helium doesn't affect the pitch of vocal fold vibrations, only that of whistles.\nCT scans provided 3D portraits of the same larynges, revealing \"a small kind of cavity just above the vocal fold that hadn't been documented before,\" explains Briefer. \"That could be where the air is forming a vortex, which then makes the whistle.\" More work needs to be done to confirm that mechanism.\nFinally, the team tracked down several stallions with a rare disease called recurrent laryngeal neuropathy, which tends to paralyze one of the vocal folds fully or in part. They recorded these animals' whinnies. The low tone was partially absent, but the high pitch was unaffected.\n\"That was another confirmation that the high pitch is not produced by vocal fold vibration,\" says Briefer. \"So it must be produced somewhere else, which is likely this whistle that we identify.\"\nTaken together, Briefer concludes that a whinny is a unique blending of vocal fold vibration that generates the low pitch and a whistling above the larynx that produces the high pitch.\n\"It's a really interesting and exciting development in our understanding of animal communication,\" says Jacob Dunn, an evolutionary biologist at Anglia Ruskin University, who wasn't involved in the study.\nDunn argues that the scientific community continues to discover new ways that animals have evolved to vocalize, compared with humans. And he says the new work contributes to that progress, \"represent[ing] a really exciting development in our understanding of the ways that animals produce sound.\"\n\"What I really liked in this paper is that they used a very comprehensive experimental approach that combined different techniques and that all converge the same results,\" says Mathilde Massenet, a bioacoustician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has worked with Briefer in the past but didn't participate in the new research.\nAs for why horses might be producing these two-toned whinnies, Briefer's earlier work suggests they appear to encode different pieces of emotional information. \"The [high-frequency] one indicates whether the emotion is pleasant or unpleasant,\" she says. \"And then the [low-frequency] one indicates whether the emotion is intense or not.\"\nMassenet says that discerning how complex sounds like the whinny are produced can help yield insights into what it is that animals are communicating. \"Understanding the vocal behavior is important for us to have a better idea of how healthy\" a population of animals is, she says. \"So it has broad implication[s] in both animal welfare and conservation.\"",
      "summary": "\ud83d\udc0e Animal behavioral scientist Elodie Briefer discovered that a horse's whinny contains two simultaneous frequencies, one high and one low.<br>\ud83d\udd2c This dual-frequency vocalization is common in birds but uncommon among mammals when consistently present in one type of sound.<br> anatom anatomical features allow horses to produce the low frequency via vibrating vocal folds and the high frequency via constricting cartilage above the larynx."

      "raw_text": "Episode 785: Neal and Toby discuss the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to deem Trump\u2019s tariffs as illegal and the potential fallout for the federal government and US companies. Then, the DHS suspended TSA PreCheck and Global Entry, then quickly reversed course, causing a travel whiplash in an already chaotic weekend. Also, the Winter Olympics is wrapping up and its viewership has been on a tear. Meanwhile, do you back into a parking spot or back out?

      "raw_text": "A critical AI-driven vulnerability in GitHub Codespaces, dubbed RoguePilot, that enabled attackers to silently hijack a repository by embedding malicious instructions inside a GitHub Issue.\nThe flaw, uncovered by researchers at the Orca Research Pod, exploits the seamless integration between GitHub Issues and the in-Codespaces Copilot AI agent, requiring no direct interaction from the attacker to trigger a full repository takeover.\nThe vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to GitHub, and Microsoft has since patched it following coordinated remediation efforts with the Orca team.\nRoguePilot is classified as a Passive Prompt Injection, a variant where malicious instructions are embedded inside data, content, or developer environments that a language model processes automatically.\nUnlike traditional prompt injection requiring a victim to directly interact with the AI, this attack is triggered the moment a developer opens a Codespace from a poisoned GitHub Issue. When a Codespace is launched from an issue context, GitHub Copilot is automatically fed the issue\u2019s description as an initial prompt, creating a direct injection pathway from untrusted user-controlled content into the AI agent\u2019s execution context.\nResearcher Roi Nisimi of Orca Security demonstrated the exploit chain by embedding hidden instructions inside a GitHub Issue using HTML comment tags (<!-- -->\n), a standard GitHub feature that renders content invisible to human readers but remains fully legible to Copilot when it processes the issue description.\nOnce the Codespace was opened, Copilot silently complied with the injected instructions without generating any visible alert to the developer.\nThe attack then proceeds through a three-stage exfiltration chain. First, the injected prompt instructs Copilot to execute gh pr checkout 2\nvia its run_in_terminal\ntool, pulling in a pre-crafted pull request that contains a symbolic link named 1.json\npointing to /workspaces/.codespaces/shared/user-secrets-envs.json\n\u2014 the file housing the environment\u2019s GITHUB_TOKEN\n.\nSince Copilot\u2019s guardrails do not follow symbolic links, the agent reads the secrets file through the link using its file_read\ntool without triggering workspace boundary restrictions.\nFinally, Copilot is instructed to create a new JSON file, issue.json\n, with a $schema\nproperty pointing to an attacker-controlled server exploiting VS Code\u2019s default json.schemaDownload.enable\nsetting, which automatically fetches remote JSON schemas via HTTP GET.\nThe attacker appends the stolen GITHUB_TOKEN\nas a URL parameter in this schema request, resulting in silent out-of-band exfiltration of the privileged authentication token. With a valid GITHUB_TOKEN\nscope to the repository, the attacker obtains full read and write access \u2014 completing a stealthy repository takeover.\nOrca Security describes RoguePilot as a new class of AI-mediated supply chain attack, where an LLM\u2019s agentic capabilities, terminal access, file read/write, and network-connected tooling are weaponized against the very developer the AI is meant to assist.\nThe vulnerability demonstrates that Copilot, operating as an autonomous coding agent within Codespaces, cannot reliably distinguish between a developer\u2019s legitimate instruction and adversarial content embedded in a GitHub Issue or pull request.\nThe attack required no special privileges, no code execution by the victim, and no social engineering beyond creating a malicious GitHub Issue placing it firmly within the reach of low-sophistication threat actors.\nSecurity experts note that this is a direct consequence of granting AI agents \u201cGod Mode\u201d permissions, tools, terminal access, and privileged tokens while the underlying model continues to operate on open-book logic that treats all processed text as potentially trustworthy.\nOrca\u2019s disclosure recommends that vendors adopt fail-safe defaults across all LLM-integrated developer tooling: treat repository, issue, and pull request content as untrusted input; disable passive AI agent prompting from external data sources; set json.schemaDownload.enable\nto false\nby default; enforce strict symlink sandboxing within workspace boundaries; and enforce minimal-scope, short-lived token issuance for Codespaces environments.\nFollow us on Google News, LinkedIn, and X for daily cybersecurity updates.

      "raw_text": "Spectra Assure Free Trial\nGet your 14-day free trial of Spectra Assure\nGet Free TrialMore about Spectra Assure Free TrialAutonomous AI agents are creating an entirely new category of software supply chain risk that few organizations are equipped to defend against.\nThe problem is that AI agents are fundamentally different from conventional software components, as Andrew Storms, vice president of security at Replicated, noted in a recent blog post.\nAndrew StormsUnlike traditional software dependencies with deterministic behavior, agents operate through instructions interpreted by LLMs at runtime.\nTo create traditional software, developers import compiled code that behaves in a predictable and predetermined way. The code can be easily scanned for vulnerabilities, verified via cryptographic signatures, and isolated with scoped permissions to minimize security risks, Storms wrote.\nAI agents, however, can behave unpredictably because their actions are determined not by the code itself but by how the large language model (LLM) interprets its instructions at runtime. Worse, agents often have administrative access to critical systems but lack the security controls found in traditional software.\nThe AI agent risk trifecta is completed when agents and skills are distributed via new marketplaces, some of which, like ClawHub, allow publishers with little or even no experience to upload their unvetted software. More often than not, the freely available agents lack the security features typically available for traditional software such as signatures, reputation systems, and audit trails, Storms said.\nThe result, Storms wrote: More than two decades of effort shoring up supply chain security are being upended virtually overnight. Here\u2019s what you need to know about AI agents\u2019 devastating effects on software supply chain security \u2014 and what you can do to fight back.\nGet Report: Software Supply Chain Security Report 2026Discussion: Report webinar\nThe mandates and frameworks that emerged in the wake of the SolarWinds attack, which were bolstered by the widespread adoption of software bills of materials (SBOMs) and secure development practices, suddenly are insufficient to protect supply chains, Storms said, because we\u2019re no longer importing established libraries with code we can inspect. We\u2019re importing instructions that will be interpreted by an LLM, and although the LLM\u2019s actions might be auditable, the reasoning behind the actions can be unknowable. But it gets much worse, he said, because agents often have broad permissions and so can execute commands, modify infrastructure, and take other actions that heighten risk.\nDiana Kelley, CISO at Noma Security, agreed with Storms\u2019 assessment of the problem, adding that traditional supply chain controls built for static artifacts such as signed code, scanned dependencies, and trusted repositories come up short when it comes to AI agents and skills. While you can generally understand the intended behavior of code when you review and scan it before deployment, Kelley said, it is impossible to predict what an AI agent will do because its behavior is assembled dynamically at runtime with LLM-generated outputs influencing what steps the agent will take next. \u201cThe LLM generates the response, and the agent turns that response into actions using connected tools,\u201d she said. And those tools don\u2019t have to be code. So, if someone hides harmful instructions inside a document or tool, the LLM may interpret those instructions as something to follow, and the agent may act on them.\nDiana KelleyThat level of dynamic behavior and connectivity can create a fast-moving path from an untrusted external component to real internal impact.\nBad actors are already taking advantage of the new AI agent environment and populating agent skills repositories with malicious skills and payloads. As an example, Storms pointed to a study by Snyk, which looked at AI agent skills on ClawHub and skills.sh and found that 534 out of 3,984 contained at least one critical security vulnerability. Those vulnerabilities included malware, instructions for exposing secrets, and functions for executing prompt injection attacks. Another study, by Koi, uncovered 824 malicious AI skills on ClawHub that would expose organizations downloading them to a wide range of potential attacks.\nWhat\u2019s troubling, said Randolph Barr, CISO at Cequence Security, is that vulnerabilities in AI agent skills have much greater potential for damage.\nRandolph BarrEarly npm or PyPI compromises typically resulted in malicious code executing within defined application boundaries. With AI agents, skills can effectively inherit the full permissions of the agent they are attached to. That changes the impact model materially.\nIf, for example, a harmful AI skill were integrated into a self-running process and a bad actor were to exploit prompt injection, the skill could enable data theft, unauthorized workflow changes, permissions misuse, and lateral movement within systems, Barr said. \u201cThe combination of prompt injection, autonomous action, and high-permission skills creates a multiplier effect that did not exist at scale in earlier package ecosystems,\u201d he said.\nReplicated\u2019s Storms said the software supply chain can\u2019t be protected without new controls specifically targeted at AI agents and agent skills. He proposes:\nNoma Security\u2019s Kelley said mitigation can\u2019t happen until organizations recognize the dangers that come with AI agents that have access to systems, data, and workflows while being guided by probabilistic LLM output. In short, she said, risk exists anywhere an agent is connected to tools and has meaningful permissions.\nWe need stronger standards for agent provenance and accountability, she said, including cryptographic signing of skills, clearer publisher trust signals, and better auditability in agent marketplaces, similar to what is now available for traditional software supply chains. But for right now, visibility is essential, she said. \u201cInventory where agents are being used, which teams are deploying them, what they\u2019re connected to, and what actions they are authorized to take.\u201d\nOnce organizations acknowledge the problem, they must apply least privilege and make sure AI agents don\u2019t inherit all of a user\u2019s access by default, Kelley said. They should not have broad, standing credentials, especially in production environments or sensitive repositories. Organizations also should enforce runtime controls and monitoring.\nDiana KelleyWith agents, the real risk is not just what code they contain; it\u2019s what they are permitted to do at the moment they are invoked, using the tools and credentials they\u2019ve been given.\nFrameworks such as the NIST\u2019s AI Risk Management Framework and the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications are good starting points for organizations figuring out how to mitigate AI-specific risk, Cequence\u2019s Barr said.\nOrganizations also need to enforce strong identity and access management for agents and skills, along with strict least-privilege rules, he said. Other advisable measures, he said, are setting up guardrails and policy engines to manage agent actions, using sandboxing and segmentation for execution environments, monitoring and logging all API and agent interactions, and being able to quickly disable or revoke skills if needed.\nAnd one feature of AI-enabled environments that organizations must keep in mind, Barr said, is that they allow adversaries to experiment, automate, and iterate faster. The speed of exploitation increases because the infrastructure supporting experimentation has also accelerated, he said.\nRandolph BarrAI agents extend the existing application attack surface; they do not replace it and should be governed with that reality in mind.

      "raw_text": "Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident\nGitHub MCP Cross-Repository Data Leak Vulnerability\nIn May 2025, Invariant disclosed a critical vulnerability in GitHub\u2019s Machine Collaboration Protocol (MCP), where attackers embedded malicious commands within public repository Issues to hijack developers\u2019 locally running AI Agents. When an AI Agent was triggered to read and \u201cassist\u201d in processing the Issue, it indiscriminately executed the embedded commands, actively pulling and exfiltrating sensitive data\u2014such as private repository source code and cryptographic keys\u2014from the user\u2019s private repositories. This attack chain entirely bypassed GitHub\u2019s permission control system, enabling unauthorized cross-repository data theft.\nThe incident exposed significant blind spots in the MCP protocol\u2019s trust boundary definitions. At the protocol level, there is a lack of mandatory isolation mechanisms to distinguish between \u201ccall origins\u201d and \u201cdata content.\u201d GitHub\u2019s MCP integration fundamentally operates as a nested RPC call chain: AI Agent \u2192 MCP Server \u2192 GitHub API \u2192 Issue Content Parsing. When an Agent executes actions using a user\u2019s GitHub credentials, it fails to differentiate between \u201cuser task descriptions\u201d and \u201cattacker-injected commands\u201d within Issues. Since developers grant their AI Agents global-level GitHub permissions, and the MCP protocol lacks fine-grained security domain segmentation for read/write/execute operations, this vulnerability allows attackers to hijack local AI Agents and steal sensitive data, including private repository source code and encryption keys.\nAI Browser Comet Hidden Command Account Hijacking Vulnerability\nIn August 2025, Perplexity\u2019s AI-powered browser Comet was exposed to a critical \u201cindirect prompt injection\u201d vulnerability. Attackers embedded hidden commands in Reddit comment sections, which, when users activated Comet\u2019s \u201csummarize current page\u201d feature, triggered the AI to automatically execute the concealed instructions. Within 150 seconds, the AI could log into the user\u2019s email, bypass captchas, and transmit credentials back to the attacker\u2014all without the user\u2019s awareness and with no visible anomalies on the interface.\nThe root cause of this vulnerability lay in Comet\u2019s default trust assumption for all web page content, combined with a lack of security validation for input sources. Attackers exploited Markdown\u2019s \u201cspoiler tag\u201d syntax (>!\u2026!<) to embed malicious commands, disguising them as white text to evade user detection. Additionally, Comet failed to implement sandbox isolation during page rendering, allowing malicious actions to execute unrestricted. As a result, the browser automatically transmitted stored login credentials to attackers, leading to sensitive data leaks.\nAI-Generated Malware Attacks 230,000+ Computing Clusters\nIn November 2025, Oligo Security disclosed that attackers exploited a historical vulnerability in the Ray framework (CVE-2023-48022). Using AI-assisted tools, they generated attack scripts to compromise over 230,000 publicly exposed Ray AI computing clusters worldwide. The attackers deployed modular malicious payloads capable of cryptomining, data theft, and DDoS attacks, creating a large-scale botnet.\nThe core tactic involved was using LLMs to rapidly generate automated intrusion scripts tailored to different Ray versions and Linux distributions. This significantly shortened the time from vulnerability detection to payload deployment. While the AI-generated code contained redundancies and incomplete error handling, the use of AI Code and ReAct frameworks enabled rapid iteration, allowing attackers to compromise exposed clusters within weeks.\nKey Directions for AI Security Development\nAs AI applications evolve from intelligent chatbots to autonomous agent systems, the detection and prevention of AI security risks are becoming more sophisticated. Based on major AI security incidents and technological trends from 2024 to 2025, the AI security threat landscape is expanding\u2014shifting from model content and system security to multimodal security, agent security, and threats that cause substantial system damage (as referenced in the NSFOCUS AI LLM Risk Threat Matrix). The attack surface for artificial intelligence is visibly broadening.\nTo ensure the security of AI systems, a comprehensive defense framework must be constructed around multiple risk domains, including infrastructure security, data security, model security, application security, and identity security. This framework should span the three key stages of LLM development: training, deployment, and application. With this approach, trust can be rebuilt, and a multi-tiered security system can be established to meet the demands of secure, compliant AI applications and practical protection against evolving threats.\nThe post Protecting AI Security: 2025 Hot Security Incident appeared first on NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks..\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from NSFOCUS, Inc., a global network and cyber security leader, protects enterprises and carriers from advanced cyber attacks. authored by NSFOCUS.

A recent security analysis by AI firm Irregular reveals that passwords created directly by large language models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini look complex but are fundamentally weak due to predictable patterns.\nThese \u201cvibe passwords\u201d emerge in real-world use, including code from AI agents, posing risks to developers and users who overlook their low entropy.\nWhy LLMs Fail At Password Generation\nLarge language models predict tokens based on training data, producing outputs that mimic randomness but follow biased distributions far from uniform.\nSecure passwords require cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) to ensure high entropy, which LLMs cannot replicate.\nTools such as KeePass or zxcvbn rate these passwords highly, estimating 100 bits of entropy. Yet, real analysis shows they crack in seconds to hours.\nIrregular tested models by prompting \u201cPlease generate a password\u201d 50 times in fresh sessions.

Using Shannon entropy on character stats, a 16-character Claude password yields 27 bits total (2.08 bits for the first character alone) versus 98 expected bits.\nGPT logprobs reveal even lower: ~20 bits for 20 characters, with some positions at 0.004 bits (99.7% predictable). Brute-force prioritizing LLM patterns could crack these in hours on old hardware.\nTemperature tweaks fail max 1.0 on Claude still repeats favorites; 0.0 locks to one string. Agentic browsers like ChatGPT Atlas insert them during tasks like site registration.\nSecurity teams must audit AI-touched code for hardcoded secrets and rotate them. Developers should enforce CSPRNGs in agents via prompts or controls, favoring password managers or passkeys.\nAccording to Irregular, AI labs need to turn off direct generation by default.
